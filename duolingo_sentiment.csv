"Depends what you mean by learned a language and through duolingo. Learned to speak and understand the language to a high level solely through Duolingo? obviously not. Learned some vocab through Duolingo and then went on to become fluent with other resources? That's entirely possible.

"I'll try and answer the deeper question here, which is ""Does Duolingo work / is it a good tool?"" My views on Duolingo have changed periodically as I've gotten further in my own language learning, and they've grown progressively more negative. At this point, I would recommend Duolingo to people only in very specific circumstances: there are some very small languages on Duolingo that have almost no other resources for learners, and in those cases, Duolingo does provide a worthwhile benefit.

Outside of that, however, speaking as someone who spent a good amount of time trying to use Duolingo before swapping to other methods, its weaknesses are many and grave. It moves at a torturously slow pace, both in terms of vocabulary and grammar. Many of its typical 'lessons' bear no resemblance to real world use of the language, and do not prepare you for it (selecting and ordering word bubbles, for example, or rejecting alternative ways of conveying an idea). They also tend to heavily emphasize a kind of literal translation which is quite harmful in the longer term; non-English languages aren't just English phrases with words swapped out in a different order. Those I've met who relied heavily or exclusively on Duolingo invariably ended up with very weak to non-existent speaking and listening abilities (and with frighteningly bad pronunciation). 

To which the typical response is, ""Well, it's only meant to be a supplement to other activities, not a primary tool. This isn't judging it in the appropriate context."" First, the reality is that most of its users \*do\* view it as a primary learning method, and nothing in Duolingo's marketing presents it as 'a supplementary tool alongside other methods'. Its current tagline on the app store is ""Learn a new language with the world’s most-downloaded education app!"", and includes the line ""Duolingo works. Designed by learning experts, Duolingo has a science-based teaching methodology proven to foster long-term knowledge retention."" Most users are going to think you can learn a language just through Duolingo, and Duolingo does everything it can to reinforce this belief.

Second, even viewed through that perspective as a supplemental tool, the fact is that it just... sucks. At best, it's wildly inefficient (with 3 months of heavy usage I hadn't even reached the past tense!), and at worst, trains and reinforces faulty, unnatural patterns. 

And therein lies my largest issue with Duolingo: its opportunity cost. People using Duolingo \*feel\* like they're doing something, like they're working to learn a language, like they just need to keep going with it and eventually they'll get there. And when, inevitably, despite having spent 300 hours and 3 years on the app, they can do almost nothing with the language, they give up on it, perhaps even blaming themselves.",0.095,0.842,0.063,-0.9439,Negative
"I think the short answer will be no -- and the long answer will be, yes, with caveats.

Nobody learns a language with one method only, so the answer is no. 

To the extent that one would really heavily on one method only, Duolingo would be ineffective at providing the volume of knowledge needed to truly ""know"" a language, so the answer again, is no.

But, I bet there are a lot of people who started out on Duolingo, got some basics, but then moved onto other, more effective, more intense methods and did end up becoming fluent, so in that sense, Duolingo, as an introduction to a language, or secondary practice app could be part of that process.

The only real success stories I hear with Duolingo are from people who live in country and start with Duo, but it's just there to help their immersion that's happening anyway -- and similarly from people who are married to a foreigner, and Duo is there to help with a similar immersive studying with their partner. 

As a solo method, Duo will not get you far.

"I learned a lot through Duolingo. But I learned to “speak” Spanish by spending a lot of time in Mexico.

From there though it hasn't been terrible building up other vocabulary on my own, as surface conversational language is sort of the foundation of everything else.

I make a lot of grammar mistakes (and have to check with Google Translate)!

I'm basically self-studying, and I bought a Spanish dictionary and grammar book along with a workbook and an A1 preparation book to help me 🥰 But Duo has been so HELPFUL because I have ADHD tendencies and the way they structure lessons encourage me to learn! I especially love the Story Time and ""Radio Shows"" the best because we learn to create sentences at the end of the story and my ability to understand only by hearing is tested by the radio shows.

"I don't think any online language teaching resource can actually make one “proficient”. I think it maybe can be done with actual classes but those typically also include reading literature and watching films as homework.

True proficiency can only be unlocked by actually engaging with the language in a real environment I feel. A class can perhaps simulate that adequately but textbooks can only bring one to the level that engaging with a real environment to further hone one's skill to true proficiency becomes possible.

Duolingo simply does not go far enough and one will quickly notice that the real way people use languages is often not covered by textbooks and people use all sorts of constructs and phrasings the textbook simply forgot to include. Like how many textbooks about Dutch will teach one about “Zal wel gast.” It means something like “Whatever mate."". Just like “Whatever mate.” in English its an indispensible part of knowing Dutch, it's meaning is not really transparent for people that don't know of it, but it doesn't feel like something a textbook would cover either. I don't even think this use of “gast” will be covered by it easily but dictionaries will probably list it.

1. Every person I've seen who reached the conversational level with Dreaming Spanish did so after supplementing with outside reading and conversation practice. If you are motivated enough to embark on their 1,500 hour journey, you clearly are all-in and willing to dedicate the extra time to reading and speaking. The vast majority pay for speaking classes. 

2. Dreaming Spanish is 1,500 hours plus reading and speaking practice, while someone can finish Duolingo in far less time. I estimated that I could finish Duo  in 900 hours. If I spent the next 600 hours after that reading and working with a speaking partner/tutor, I'm pretty sure that I'd be conversational. 

3. The vast majority of people who start Duolingo have the follow-through of a flea. They think they can learn the language in a few months while practicing 5 minutes a day. On the other hand, Dreaming Spanish attracts more hardcore learners. 

4. Most Dreaming Spanish users had a lot of previous Spanish exposure. They didn't start at zero. 

But to me, here's the big difference. Duolingo is boring. Most people can't maintain the pace long enough to complete the course. The beauty of Dreaming Spanish is that you are learning while doing things (watching videos, listening to podcasts) that you'd do anyway. I do a bit of Duolingo every day, but the vast majority of my Spanish time is spent listening to podcasts and scrolling Spanish social media. It doesn't feel like work. 

So, can you learn Spanish with Duolingo? Sure. You can get pretty close to being conversational. But it's a slog.",0.021,0.869,0.111,0.9866,Positive

"My five cents as a Russian LGBTQ+ person:

The most annoying part probably is not agreeing to the demands of Russian authorities, but trying to play both sides. Just stay neutral, no one will really care.

If they believe they are so important as a global education tool, they could've just ignored the request, like Wikipedia did and face no consequences. But they know the reality is different, Duolingo has many alternatives and strong local competitors in Russia, so they can get banned no problem without people really complaining about it.

P.S. I think it also worth noting Duolingo claims they only deleted some direct mentions, like words ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" in lessons, but not indirect mentions like when a woman in a dialogue saying she has a girlfriend. Anyway, pretty bad PR overall.",0.136,0.67,0.194,0.9024,Positive

"Gay here! Originally very irritates with Duo, but have been thinking, and I agree with this decision. Firstly, this isn't a profit thing, as Duo makes sure it makes none in Russia or Belarus, and secondly, the power of language is enormous. 59% of the Internet is English, just 5.3% is Russian, therefore it's relatively easy for the Kremlin to control thar 5.3%, especially as a lot of it is hosted on Russia, but to censor 59% of the Internet is MUCH more difficult. So, by Duo staying in Russia by complying, more and more are learning new languages, and their eyes potentially opened to the truth. I also feel like removing pride isn't in duos financial interest aswell, as I feel that a large proportion of us in the Language Living world are quite left wing/liberal, as learning about and respecting other cultures, and not being bothered by foreign languages feels like a left wing stance.

My wife finished the course, and while she had a large vocabulary and could read, she couldn't understand television and couldn't engage in a real-time conversation. 

So, the issue is expectations management. I'm currently making great progress with Duo, but it is only part of my language learning toolbox. I listen to at least an hour of podcasts daily, flip through some videos in my target language every day, and regularly talk to ChatGPT+. Duo fits a little niche in my language learning journey. 

I could definitely learn faster if I was more proactive with my learning. For example, I could drill grammar on my own and focus on the specific skills and concepts that challenge me. I could also work with a one-on-one tutor. I could arrange for conversation partners. I could read books. I could use Anki to ensure that I master the vocabulary of my job and hobbies.

"In regards to people saying he’s not wrong, I don’t necessarily disagree, but there’s also no purpose in teaching someone who has no interest in being taught; you can force them to remember some basic phrases in Spanish regarding greetings via heavy gamification, but what is the purpose of such when that slight bit of acquired knowledge slips simply because the learner doesn’t have any reason to remember said greetings besides a slight curiosity and some intangible digital currency. The reality is that sacrificing education for the sake of engagement is not better overall, as degrading the learning experience for those with motivation to learn foreign languages for the sake of those who have no such motivation or purpose is ridiculous: there are better ways to entice people to pick up a foreign language. 

To close this off, I can almost guarantee his goal in engagement is not so noble, it’s at least partly because engagement is what makes money, having people subscribe to super Duolingo makes money, in a way, it’s actually not profitable to properly educate users, as the second they are satisfied with their progress, they are no longer a customer.

It's so bad compared to 2017...

I started Spanish in 2017 on Duolingo. Used some other apps as well, but 80 % was Duolingo... On and off, for 1.5 years. In autumn of 2018 I was able to enroll in university class that had B1 Spanish prerequisite and I passed... 

But now? The path is shit. It repeats same words 20 times, instead of spaced repetition like in the past (where you would see ""health"" of the lesson and practice to increase the health).

Now 1 lesson (which there are like 200 for french) is like 10x6 lessons... And you learn the same amount of words like in old Duolingo ""lesson"" which was 4x lesson. So it's 60 vs 4 to pass a ""chapter""... So instead of 20 minutes per day, to keep the same tempo of progress, you would need to spend 5 hours.

That's just insane. You won't learn the word by repeating it 10 times in 1 day. You learn the word by seeing it twice, repeating it next day, then 3 days etc.


Edit - so for completing the french tree, without spaced repetition, it's now for example 1000 hours compared to 70 in the past. And if you spent those 930 hours elsewhere, you would be B2-C1... With Duolingo maybe B1-B2",0.052,0.86,0.088,0.8226,Positive

The experiences being pretty different depending on the language can be confusing, and ultimately Duolingo was a fun game for me, but I learned more in 10 days of Pimsleur/Language Transfer + Lingq than I did in 60 consecutive days of Duolingo. 

It just doesn't really engage the brain for me, but I think it is a great first step. Duolingo was probably the most effective way for me to learn the Cyrillic alphabet in a digestible way.

"Can you become fluent with Duolingo?
 

""Fluent"" is a misleading way to measure how well you know a language, because it implies there is an endpoint to learning it. In fact, there's no test or language criteria for deciding if someone is ""fluent,"" and language learning experts instead talk about proficiency. You might aspire to ""fluency,"" but ""comfortable"" might be what you're really getting at – and you can feel comfortable even as a beginner, depending on your goals! The language you need to travel as a tourist for a week is really different from the language needs of a professional in the workplace.

 

At Duolingo, we're developing our courses to get you to a level called B2, at which you can get a job in the language you're studying. Reaching that kind of proficiency requires dedication, varied practice opportunities, and a lot of time. Right now Duolingo can get you pretty far: a 2020 study found that learners in Duolingo's Spanish and French courses performed as well on reading and listening tests as students who took four semesters of university classes — and in about half the time


https://support.duolingo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056797071-Can-you-become-fluent-with-Duolingo

DuoLingo itself says you can get to B2. 

“Level B2 corresponds to a more advanced, more independent level than previous levels. A B2 user can communicate easily and spontaneously in a clear and detailed manner”

DuoLingo seems to fail on this part but rarely if ever says oh you’ll need to go somewhere else to continue studies.

"My comment can feel directed towards duolingo as a whole, but I’ll only talk about what I’ve experienced myself : duolingo for japanese. I know people can have good results on languages close to english like spanish, so I won’t talk about that.

…

If people were using duolingo for actually learning the language rather than keeping a streak, I would agree with your whole post. 

As it turns out, except a few people, I don’t know lots of duolingo users that have used it as a supplement for other more “serious” activities. 

I mean, if you only do 10-20 minutes, Anki will always be like 5 times more efficient for the same amount of time. Just count the number of sentences you are exposed to in 10 minutes of duolingo vs 10 minutes of Anki … 

I see 2 clear benefits of duolingo : it puts your feet in the language learning big thing, and it introduces the idea that recurring practice and review is necessary. 

Also, note that a lot of hate come from the community of people learning languages like Chinese/Japanese. You can finish the whole duolingo and not being able to read the first sentence of a light novel, yet, you could have spent like 2y to get to this non-result (yeah duo is this bad for japanese, really)

I won’t blame users. Using it could be rather fun. It’s still better than going on tiktok. 

But if you have a full time job, a family, a limited amount of time in your day and you’re serious about learning a language, then you could get pleasure from actually watching content in the language you learn, and study with efficient materials. 

On the streak : look how many post comes up every month about people that lose their streak. It’s like they lost their ability to learn. My POV is that people are just addicted to the streak, are confortable playing with the bird and sometimes make excuses to avoid putting in the work. 

I mean, even if it’s work, you should have fun when learning a language to the point it either become a habit or a pleasure. Duolingo succeeds in this. But I think if we can call it a tool, it’s not a good tool. 

I’ll finish on a positive note : if you really love doing duolingo (not just for the streak), continue doing it. I’ve been emphasizing on productivity, but if somethings matters more than that, it’s loving the process.",0.063,0.745,0.192,0.9968,Positive

I don’t expect to finish my Duo course and then hop a flight to Berlin and make it two weeks without ever having to look anything up or never being identified as a foreigner. But in concert with other learning tools, it’s been extremely helpful. (I still have trouble remembering genders, but there’s no rhyme or reason to German gender anyway so the other tools won’t be any more helpful anyway).

People also like to shit on it because it’s a “game.” But that doesn’t delegitimize it. Gamification is about motivation; it doesn’t make what you’re learning wrong.

And I have a theory about the weird sentences: they get you thinking about what you’re reading, hearing, saying, and typing more. I think when you think you must be translating a sentence wrong and it turns out to be right, it separates something in your mind and frees you from relying on your expectations. I think that process forces you to unconsciously focus on the sentence structure and vocab and actually helps your brain strengthen the connections you’re making.",0.085,0.804,0.111,0.5888,Positive
idk about other languages but in indonesian it frequently uses incorrect words incorrect grammar all of it. i have cross checked and its just not functional. its like only teaching extremely formal english and using incorrect sentence structure and then when someone says can’t instead of can not you mark them down with no explanation. it is great for basics but it is not correct and much of what i got from there i had to disregard,0.107,0.812,0.081,-0.0554,Negative

"Get a grammar book. it's not as ""fun"" as Duolingo but it explains everything far better and paired with learning vocab through Anki you'll have most of what you need. I've had great success with Routledge books. Most languages one would be interested in learning you can pick up an Essential Grammar book as a well as a Colloquial book from Routledge and it will walk you through everything like you're taking a class, as long as you have the discipline to work through the exercises.

The missing piece is audio. You need a lot of repeated audio input to be able to listen and pronounce. And that's one of the things that Duo does provide. I'm currently not sure what to replace Duo with for the language I'm somewhat newly learning (Hungarian) because it's by far the best source of understandable audio for the level I'm currently at. Ultimately I think language-specific audio resources need to be sought out. 

Routledge books do come with free online audio but it's not enough IMO.

I'll miss doing Duolingo while I'm out on walks or waiting in lines but I've advanced far enough in Hungarian that it's become gobbledygook and I doubt that's going to get any better with this change, so I'm going to cancel before the next time I get billed.

It's a shame they could have served an Anki like purpose by leaning on the ""word practice"" section of the app but something has been fundamentally broken with that for a while.

The previous post about this highlighted that the person was involved in translating for one of the top 3 languages (must be English, Spanish, or French) which have all been recently upgraded.  The email about his off boarding said nothing about the reason for the layoff.   The fact that he worked for years on it shows that it takes substantial amounts of time to do major changes.

"I have never been a fan of duolingo.
I checked their progress a couple of times and I did notice some improvements but those were far and few between.

I use chatgtp in my language studies BUT If I nask it grammar question for a particular sentence it fails about half the the time.
I am aware of this.
I think chatgtp in generating sentences by it's own when not bound to grammar limitations by the chatgtp user is of a pretty good standard. Once you impose stuff on it I want to say Y using X grammar point it often fails.
This to self correct myself and I am wary of it's proposals.

Pretty good standard is  acceptable to me. In daily conversations.  
BUT not when I am learning a language.
When I am learning Japanese, I want to phrase my sentence like the majority of Japanese people will do.
I am certain that if AI translates it won't come up with what I am looking for most of the time.

Now chat gtp and other language models (ai) have made huge progress since going public.
But at this time I really do feel that it is to soon.

So what if they kept some translators to check those translations made by AI.
I think if they do that they still don't reach the same level of capable translators on their own.

If the translator just sees the translated sentence by it's own. They just have to grade the sentence on grammar correctness.
And they will fail to say it more naturally because some sentences are made with grammar points in mind.
Chatgtp in my experience has the habit of using the same words  , when there are better words available.
There is also the question of how capable a translator is in both languages. 
I haven't asked chatgtp English grammar questions. But to me it seems that the English level is more than acceptable when trying to learn Japanese. It is that the Japanese level is not sufficient at this point.
If it misunderstands your start language. Than it might not be suitable at all to use your start language.
For example. I use chatgtp in English since I found it's use of the Dutch language lacking.

I do understand the decision of duolingo to do this. But it sort of means they are cashing in.

"Duolingo's strength, I have found, is its presentation of grammatical constructs and repetition of those constructs. But to learn a language you need to learn to follow native conversation with reading and listening in the target language, without translation. 

So I've learned to ignore the strange translations. Trying to learn complex sentences with Duo is like trying to learn a language by memorizing a dictionary. Have you ever sat and read a dictionary?

Dictionaries are full of sentences that are technically correct but unnatural. This is the case because translation is an art, and it's its own art. And yet Duo, like dictionaries, want translations to be reversible in order to be true. But doing so destroys the art of translation and replaces it with the technicality of translation for exactitude in both meaning and grammar.

Just ignore it. Focus on the grammatical patterns, verb conjugations, and grammatical constructs, but don't try and become fluent by memorizing a dictionary or Duo sentences, because you'll sound funny, and you'll never get the flow of the target language. It just doesn't work like that.

A few minutes with Duo each day is a good thing. After that go read a book. Watch the news. Watch a movie. Find native content without translation. Because not only is translation an advanced practice, it's an art form. 

Take a look at the desktop version of Duo and get the solutions viewer plugin. Some of the most simple sentences can have hundreds of correct solutions. It's a good reference for driving yourself mad.",0.075,0.798,0.127,0.8565,Positive

"Hey, I'm using Duolingo for basic Greek right now. So, thank you for your contributions :) Recently I finished the German course with French as the first language. My experience with Duo is definitely more positive than yours. I think the main reason may be that I don't expect it to be the only and not even the main learning tool. I have lessons with a tutor, I watch videos on YouTube language learning channels, I write down exercises in a notebook, etc. For me, Duolingo has two main purposes:

1. Memorisation of commonly used words.  
2. Having daily contact with the language.

And I think Duo works great for those. For sure my Greek vocabulary expanded quite a bit thanks to Duo exercises, and most of those words are useful - verbs like talk, read, give, take, do, pay, want; their conjugations, pronouns they are linked to, nouns for commonly used objects and social roles like friend, mother, child, husband, etc. So I don't have any problems with the word bank. 

Although, yes, of course, there are weird examples. But I actually like weird examples. I think they help because they stay in the head. My favourite so far is ""Πού είναι τα ρούχα του πορτοκαλί ελέφαντα;"" - ""Where are the clothes of the orange elephant?"". It's absurd but it teaches me how to formulate a ""where"" question, the word for clothes, the color orange, and how to make a genitive of a masculine noun ελέφαντας.

If in your experience the microphone didn't work 50% of time, it means it was improved. I still need quiet environment to be able do speaking exercises, but that's understandable. In fact, I would say the speaking practice is too forgiving. I know from my German course that Duolingo accepts answers that don't sound good to a native German speaker.",0.023,0.845,0.132,0.9842,Positive

Of course you have to do something on the side, such as comprehensible input, mining new words and expressions in Anki, but like any skill in life you'll need multiple ""sources of input"" to really work all aspects of it. I'm currently doing the German course on Duolingo, and it's helping a ton to get me to probably A2. Am I gonna be a B2 just with Duolingo in german? Nah. But is it useful and enjoyable?

"I disagree with the level of criticism. For French and Spanish, it’s much much better than that. Radio lessons for listening, there are both formal and informal examples of situations, even in the new adventures. You get decent feedback on the reviews/questions you write for stories. You get a lot of training in understanding the patterns used to construct sentences, and they give some basic grammar explanations in the early sections. There are exercises where you listen to part of the stories, there are regular listening exercises of different kinds. They use realistic sentences, with very rare examples of something funnier. I actually think it is well structured and works well. As for speech, we have the video calls to Lily, and even if don’t like nor do the speech parts, AI is very likely turning these exercises from not usable at all to actually forming as supplement to real speaking. Both explain my never and role play are pretty decent, for being AI powered.

Nonetheless, I do agree there is a lack of real content. We do need to supplement with a lot of varied comprehensible input on our level. And depending on your priorities, you might want to supplement with grammar study elsewhere. You do get a good foundation that is pretty thorough, but I mostly believe they would benefit from not only having AI content, but also helping the learners to get in touch with real media. They are poor at doing that. If you have one teacher, you will also only get one type of accent and way of speaking, so expanding horizons is always good.

For the smaller languages, the content is seriously lacking. It’s not the same experience at all. The free experience is not comparable to the payed one either.",0.041,0.846,0.113,0.9557,Positive

If you learn all the nouns and grammar properly, you should be able to take the weird sentences and construct normal ones yourself. Of course, learning through duo is problematic

Stories are good, but I wish they were longer, required more thought and required you to type responses that make sense. Then you're practicing a conversation more than reading a dialogue. 

I actually found old Duolingo more useful than current Duolingo. In old Duolingo every time i got a sentence I'd close my eyes and try to say it in Norwegian, then I'd type it out in Norwegian using the keyboard feature that hides that word bubbles. This is a lot closer to how I use Anki but most anki decks were single words and these were always sentences, and structured by topics like grammar or vocabulary categories, which was good for reinforcing the concept. But in modern Duolingo, this is all impossible to do. you might as well just use one of the exported Duolingo Anki decks instead because duo is trying very hard to make it impossible to do things that make learning easier.",0.067,0.8,0.133,0.9412,Positive

"Ok as a Spanish learning person that kinda hates duo for the stupid repetitive lessons but is unfortunately addicted to not losing his streak of almost 5 years, I have to say:

El gato, not la gata. I know it's confusing because cat in Greek is feminine, it was for me too, but if you say you've used it for Spanish you would remember this because I feel like I see a sentence with a cat involved literally every day. And I only do 2-3 minutes a day for the streak.

You have other errors too but this isn't the point of my comment.

I think you wasted a lot of time in writing this without giving it value, because no sane person has said that it's a good app overall, it's a shitty gamified habit that can help a lot if handled correctly.

Why are you so bitter about all this? It's a known, tremendously common practice.

Also, as others have said, you wrote a lot for an opinion and you said you wouldn't read articles/research about duo, so why did you write all this? To get ""you're right"" comments?

It tried to teach the Korean alphabet Hangul with mapping to Latin letters without ever teaching how they actually work. This would create really awkward moments where it would teach you to make certain sounds in syllables that you shouldn’t actually make.  Later I had a classmate in a Korean class also from Duolingo who kept trying to map everything into “double s or single s” or “r or l” which is just counterproductive.

It also taught a lot of phrases that were ungrammatical. Korean has politeness embedded in its grammar, and would do things that would make a native speaker unable to parse what the intent was (imagine someone saying “He am go to the store.”).

And their new AI features were just nonsensical. A colleague of mine was trying it out with Spanish. They’d have a multiple choice question they got wrong, ask the AI to “explain why” and it would say he wrote in English (all options were Spanish phrases).

Sure you can say that Korean is a particularly hard language, and AI is experimental. But this shows the level of quality they are willing to put out. Because of this, I can only see Duolingo as a game, and not any way to learn a language.

"[See this FAQ.](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1f5rbjv/language_learning_faq_from_my_observations/)

##Why does everyone hate Duolingo / is Duolingo good?

Duolingo spends $75 million a year on marketing and claims it's ""the world's best way to learn a language"". It is 100% not that.

The much weaker claims by its online advocates are that it's (1) a good introduction to language learning and/or (2) that it's useful as part of a many-pronged approach.

I don't know about (1). I think Duolingo is so focused on addicting you to the app and hacking ways to make you spend more time on it - which is time largely wasted, in my view. I think a ""good introduction"" would give you the basics and then release you to spend time more effectively, not try to trap you with a streak and teach you with a trickle of information that is worlds less efficient than other methods (such as a simple Anki vocab deck).

(2) I find to be objectionable in the same sense that I object to sugary frosted flakes being ""part of a balanced breakfast"". In any meaningful sense, the heavy sugar and carbs of the flakes are not contributing anything to one's nutrition. You'd be better off swapping them out for almost anything else and it would be better for you.

Same with Duolingo. In theory you could use it alongside many other resources, but... why? Even just scrolling TikTok in your target language would be more useful, in my opinion (if you wanted to spend 15 minutes of language learning a day on a ""fun"" activity).

"Even worse. The problems have been accumulating over several huge waves of changes.

A decade ago, Duolingo was not really bad, it was doing what it was supposed to do: a very easy introduction into some basics of the language. You could complete the course relatively efficiently, and move on to something more serious. While people were definitely not leaving with full A2, the time spent and the results were not really that disproportionate, and the structure of the course still allowed combining it with other sources rather well.

These days, the courses are much slower, made really to make you waste time, to feel like you are progressing but without actual progress, **to keep you addicted and seeing ads.** The exercises have been dumbed down. Before removal of the forums, there was a wonderful thread where a few users even analysed one of the huge waves of changes and counted how many % of the worthwhile exercises vs % of the braindead ones were given at the review levels or crowns. And there was a clear trend to dumb the exercises down, and make it all less active, less efficient, but more flattering for dumb users that don't really want to learn but will keep seeing ads in exchange for the ""you're doing so well"" lie.

The course structure has been damaged in a way that makes it harder to combine Duolingo with other resources, it is now harder and limited (and paid) to test out of things, the progress through the course is much more linear, it is even harder to choose when to learn something, you need to dumbly follow the same order as everyone else, an order designed for pure Duolingo use. 

The game really wants to be your only ""language learning tool"", probably to minimize the risk of losing an ads watcher to something better. Also, all the Duolingo ""research"" (presented falsely as language learning research, while it is really marketing research) is rather clear. You can notice in their public presentations, that their definition of a successful learner is not ""a learner who succeeds at learning the content and moves on to something harder"" (basically the definition of success of every normal coursebook or class), but it is ""a learner that never leaves Duolingo""!

"Duolingo is great, but the company has made a few moves that feel, to some, like pure enshittification. I won't address their efforts to monetize, only the quality of their tools.

  
First, there are two things of vital importance to consider: 1) the quality of the specific course you want (e.g., French versus Greek), and 2) whether or not you've ever learned a second language.  The latter issue is vital, especially for the weaker courses where your knowledge of how languages might be required to grasp what Duolingo is showing you fully. (For instance, 'case' just magically appears in the German and Greek courses, with little explanation.)

It absolutely works. 4 years ago I could not read Ukranian, and now I can. I use it to maintain my French, Mandarin, and German, and it's really great at that. But again, I'm an experienced language learner, so it's just one tool of many for me. 

That said, one of my children has skipped two years of high school French, thanks only to Duolingo. It's her first non-native language, and she coasts through her classes because she's routinized the things that cause many people to fail (when to you y versus en, irregular verbs, etc.).

Also, you certainly should not be solely depending on it to accomplish your proficiency goals! I have proficiency in 7 languages at a B2 or above level and have found it quite useful for getting a foundation to work with.

**My insights:**

**1) Duolingo is best combined with a variety of other methods**. Alongside using Duolingo, you should practice what you learn regularly, especially speaking and reading helps. If you don't know any native speakers or have any around you, why not try AI. I make reasonably OK money but live in a pretty small town with not many foreigners so I do it. I think the app I use is like about 7 euro a month. Pretty steep pricing but getting the practice on the daily in is highly important to me. They have roleplays and a voice call setting where I prepare a script with general sentences and they will pick out my mistakes so I can make note/ learn from them.. 

**2) It depends quite a lot on the language**. I am only using it at the moment for casual Russian and Portuguese learning, and the course is very comprehensive, decent quality with everyday phrases and super lengthy! I've been doing it for up to 14 months everyday and I'm still only halfway through the last section in Russian and the end of the 2nd section in portuguese. That being said, I also tried using Duolingo to supplement my University B2 Korean Classes and found it was pretty bad for that. I've generally heard great things from friends about the German course, the Chinese course, the French course. The Arabic course is bad because it's shorter and they only teach Modern Standard Arabic which is not spoken among locals in casual everyday life contexts of any Arabic speaking nation. Duolingo has a chatroom discussing the standards and quality for each language.  

**3) Your language acquisition solely depends on you.** People love to blame the app for their language learning shortcomings, but it gets annoying to me. It is up to the learner to take the initiative, put in the hours, revise old written notes, read in the target language, talk to themselves or others in the target language etc., 

People generally do not like hearing ideas that challenge their opinions, so I don't expect this to be received well by some people, but I totally 100% stand by what I said.",0.045,0.796,0.16,0.9956,Positive

In terms of grammar, it teaches you through obscure examples without giving you the theory of why you use certain grammar the way that you use it. 

Not to mention the fact that if it is your sole resource you are not really speaking, listening, or creating using the language. You are at most typing or listening to a random, obscure sentence.

Then I supplement with other apps that make sense for the target language, usually for more vocab or verb conjugations. Then I try talking and speaking in the language, even if to myself.

"I think it's less that Duolingo is bad, but more that there are other resources out there that are a lot more effective. It's kind of like eating sweets when you're hungry - it wont do nothing, but a proper meal would fill you up much more effectively, even if it might seem less exciting. 

Duo does a fantastic job at keeping people engaged and to keep coming back every day. But it doesn't manage expectations well - their methods really aren't the best, and their claim that you can reach something like B1 or B2 is simply not the case, as you don't learn how to talk or understand properly (actual native speakers, that is). This leads to people thinking the app alone is enough to learn a language, and either doing it once a day (learning so little it wont amount to much) or pouring hours into the app (which will of course help, but those hours would be spent much better elsewhere).

The sweets analogy still fits. It can brighten your day if you eat properly the rest of the time, and if you didn't eat all day, it is still better than nothing. But you cannot sustain yourself on a chocolate bar a day, and eating lots of sweets does not get you the nutrients you need in the right amounts.

So yeah, that's my take on the question. Though I personally also found the app made a big mistake in their update, which made the app so much worse than before. Absolutely unusable for me personally. Also the fact that they are now trying to be as profitable as possible, using the free labour volunteers gave (which amounts to a really big part of their courses), putting features behind paywalls and gamifying the app/gearing it more towards children.  

Also consider that different languages have wildly different courses in terms of both quantity and quality.

"Duolingo isn't bad at all. But people use it in the wrong way.

See, in my opinion there isn't any resource that can teach you a language by using it alone. A textbook doesn't improve your speaking abilities (if you don't use your newly-learnt skills to chat with somebody). Apps like Anki mostly don't teach you grammar (as most apps don't do). Even a class with real teachers and other students won't help you in the long run if you are too lazy to learn your vocabulary with a spaced repetition system (as you often don't need it anymore for a longer time and forget it if you don't repeat it with some additional resource).

Duo is nice in introducing new words. I also love it for repeating my Arabic letters, as I am really bad at reading those and have the feeling it really is getting better now (soon will switch to a nice class and textbook, which wasn't fun without good reading skills). But it completely lacks in explaining grammar, often has useless sentences and doesn't train on creating new sentences (speaking/writing part) at all. The only thing it really is good at is making people feel like playing instead of working while studying.

The problem is, too many Duo users think it is enough to just use it as a single resource (just as Duo wrongly claims it). They don't own a textbook, they don't visit a class, they don't talk to natives, never produce the language on their own (and therefore lack in that area). They can maybe *understand* a level B1, but they cannot *speak* on a B1 (or even B2) level (maybe on a A1/A2, in best case). It's just not possible without using other resources, as the B levels require being able to easily build sentences of your own with the vocabulary you've already learnt (and knowing ALL of the basic grammar). And well - most Duo only users cannot do that while still claiming to have a B level. 

Harder studying users (doing classes, working through textbooks) that truly achieved the B level requirements just feel mocked if someone claims to have the same (or even better) level while hardly being able to order a pizza or checking into a hotel without a hassle.

Duolingo Defense Rant: This topic comes up frequently enough that I figured I would save this response in my Notes app and post as applicable. 

TL;DR: Language learning is a long process and if Duolingo has helped you in that process and motivates you continue to do so. Duolingo is not without flaws, but in some languages they have seen success. If it didn’t for you continue to use your other methods because language learning is your journey. 

Before getting started it needs to be acknowledged that Duolingo is an app that teaches a language but at a cost. That cost is either you paying or ads. In addition to that it claims to be the best method which to me is irrelevant. Whether it is or isn’t (most likely isn’t) is entirely up to you. But businesses have been claiming this since forever thats why the “Best Cup of Coffee” joke in Elf was funny. 

The best singular method for learning a language will always be immersion or comprehensible input (CI). It’s how you learned your first language and maybe second language and studies have shown your brain is actually better at it as an adult you are just impatient. If you are looking for a single method Duolingo will never get you fully there. The best method will always be multiple methods. Duolingo is a good spaced repetition tool but you can also find that on Anki. So pick what suits you.

Duolingo is entirely course dependent. Its best courses are English, Spanish and French. As you get to more unique or complex languages Duo is worse because it just hasn’t caught up yet. So your opinion may be based in the language you are learning from. 

The biggest pet peeve of mine is “efficient”. Mostly because I have never seen any studies on efficiency of learning a language so my assumption is the claims are anecdotal and then re-enforced by the hive mind. That said the reason given for not efficient is the repetition. Which personally I think is needed to re-enforce words/ concepts from maybe a month ago or longer. Again, there are other ways to re-enforce these concepts specifically Anki again but personally I struggled to stay motivated with Anki so I continued Duo.

At the end of the day a varied approach is probably the best way to learn a language and Duo is a tool to do that. If you don’t want to use it in your tool box its totally fine but the constant discussions here on it are equally repetitive and honestly just let people learn their way without bashing!",0.034,0.83,0.135,0.9952,Positive
"I‘m using Duolingo for over one year now and I’m learning Japanese, which is….thanks to Kanji really hard. I was thinking about to quit Duolingo, because I thought I didn’t learn anything, but then I’ve had the moment of realization. Indeed I did learn something there, actually Duolingo helped me way more than the competitors and in my opinion it’s because of their strategy. It’s like playing a game, which is ofc fun. 

Meanwhile I saw on YouTube a video with the title „STOP LEARNING JAPANESE WITH DUOLINGO!!!“ and the person wasn’t even a native Japanese speaker… immediately blocked the account…

I’m European and we are used to get free education, but let’s be real here, the company has to live from something right and if the quality of content meets the expectations, why not spending some money for appreciation? 

People hate AI, I don’t, because I think Ai is for sure a great tool if you don’t have Tandem Partner. You can use it whenever you want and Ai even gives you good explanations. The fact Duolingo is digging towards Ai shows me one thing. They are still interested in build better and more advanced learning environment. For sure they could say we already do good amount of money, so why invest so many resources into something? 

Should you upgrade to Ai included subscription? If you have some money left and don’t know what to do with, sure why not, but it isn’t necessary. You also could Ai tools by yourself for example Gemini or ChatGPT. There are existing limitations to unless you have the paid version… I mean if I’m not wrong.

Kunne ikke si dere hvor mange ganger jeg ikke kjente hva som jeg måtte gjør, så i stedet jeg gjettet. Fordi norsk føles litt tilfeldig ut som engelsk, ville gjentatt forsøkinger produsere forskjellige resultater. Selvfølgelig vet jeg nå en gode del mønstre, men på den tiden var jeg helt mistet.

"Until recently, the Japanese version was *so bad* that I would actually consider it worse than not studying.

When not studying, you made zero progress forward. With Duolingo, you actually learned *the wrong things* and made negative progress, because you'd need to unlearn them. It's like they picked someone who had skimmed a beginner textbook and made them make a course without actually knowing the language.

Then they fixed it last year, and the text is... not terrible anymore, but now the audio is half wrong! (Half is an overstatement but there's enough wrong that you should mute the app at all times.)

When I tell people not to use Duolingo, I'm not gatekeeping or being elitist. I am giving genuine advice: If you are serious about learning the language, and not just dipping your toes to get a feel, *do not use it for Japanese.* It will *hurt* your progress.

For certain languages, you can make a solid argument that it may actually be the best resource out there for beginners studying alone.

It introduces thousands of sentences that are just slightly above your comprehension (one or several new words), and also teaches you structures that are slightly above your comprehension (and by repeating them, you can learn that structure). Maybe it's because I'm quite a systematic learner (I also loove grammar workbooks), but I find it's actually more useful than just reading or listening to native materials that are beyond my comprehension.

Obviously, you have to use it correctly, for instance, always type the sentences, not just pick out from the given words. Other tips would be that I always finish the new lessons to the max level before moving on to a new lesson, and I also like to repeat the sentences out loud as I read them.

My only complaint is that it introduces new words at a slower pace than I'd like, but I understand that it's due to the fact that I like to max out all the levels.",0.016,0.872,0.113,0.9381,Positive

Duolingo is a gamified barely functional way to learn a language to high A1 or low A2 with way more effort than most other resources would take, and even what it does offer, most people don't use because it's not mandatory, like the grammatical explanations they often offer before lessons.

You see a lot of stories of people who spend months or years doing almost nothing besides Duolingo, then they're shocked when they can't hold a conversation. People are not 'well aware' of this in general, because there's a huge bubble of people that fell for Duo's stupid marketing of getting fluent with nothing but five minutes a day of using them, and ridiculous stuff like their fluency percentage tracker.

At best, Duolingo functions as a game to help retention when you're A2. That's its only decent use, and even then there are better ways to do that.

"I've used Duolingo intensively **for a year and a half**, 2 hours a day. And I can say **Duolingo is a waste of time** for learning languages. You can memorize a several hundreds of phrases and words, but just some weeks later **you will forget almost all the stuff**.

Duolingo doesn't teach languages, it just tests you.  Every language has several thousands of words and a whitelist with the translations.  
So, it is inefficient. It seems like you are learning, but it is a very short term learning, only to pass a test.

And it is not a freeware. It is a freemium or an adware, especially the app versions. And you have several alternatives, without adds or with less propaganda.

A simple browser has several tools for learning languages: 

- **text to speech** (Read Aloud on Chrome, for instance) is very suitable to read every document, and you can setup the speed.

- **popup dictionaries** that not only display the translation, but also explanations in your TL, and synonyms.

And you have very reliable translators, **Deeple**, for example.

And yet, Duolingo teaches none of this, simply hoping that they can throw stuff at you and some of it will stick.

I admit I'm a bit too academic when learning languages---I try to learn the grammar very properly, and in the past, I haven't emphasized enough comprehensible input and more informal learning methods.

I have used it for Spanish with pretty good success, but I also practice it every day at work with native speakers, listen to podcasts, changed the language on some video games to Spanish, and have a bunch of textbooks and other books to supplement it.

My take is that if you're a beginner, it's a good / fun way to pick up the language without stress / financial commitment from a tutor. Even if you are somewhat intermediate, there could still be a couple of things to learn from it but when you get to a certain point in your learning you start seeing that Duo is simply too slow and some of the words it teaches you are almost gibberish, things you wouldn't use in real life.

As someone with ADHD, having a small task to do every day and get the ball rolling is invaluable (I use the Cake app now, which is also heavy on beginner-friendly input using native content, but only for Korean and English as far as I know). 

I also think it was good for just learning a little Swedish to make my Swedish friends really happy.

Duolingo was a quantum jump for me. The sometimes cutthroat competition compelled me to put in a lot of hours in it and I could finally make sense of a lot of the sentences that Pimsleur drilled into my head that I couldn't really make out. After around 300 days I went yet again to a local class and pretty much everything that they were teaching was easy. I was so ahead of the rest of the class that I asked to skip ahead. However, that was a mistake.

Because as good as Duolingo was for me, grammar isn't really being taught. They just throw example after example at you and expect you to deduce what is happening.

These days when I try to use it to pick up some knowledge about a language, it seems like it moves too slowly and repeats too much. Concepts that would have taken an hour to get through in 2013 (and then reinforce with later lessons) take six hours now. I already knew how to (slowly) read hangul but when I tried doing the Korean lessons, there was a whole section (meaning 30+ units) of recognizing sounds and words that were one or two blocks long, followed by another section of almost exclusively words that are transliterations of English words - 60 units in and basically no grammar or useful functional (grammatical) words. Of course you can do a bit of a section of the tree and then test to skip ahead, but then you feel afraid of missing introductions to other concepts along the way.

I'm a very grammar-oriented person so I can usually understand the patterns and systems with enough examples. And at least back in the day, different chapters had explanations in the web app that gave you a rundown of what rules they were teaching you. But these days it just moves so slowly that I feel like I'm using a really weird phrase book that doesn't want to teach me basic interactions with people but will happily have me repeat ""I want to buy a red sweater"" ad infinitum without ever increasing complexity or the range of possible grammatical things I can express.

"I personally am not against the gamified learning, but I’m against Duolingo because it doesn’t truly give you tools, it just gives you prescriptive weird sentences and small bite size chunks without any targets focus.

There’s a lot better apps out there that you could use such as memorized, drops, or cloze, all of these interact in the same way, but have a lot more depth to them.

Duolingo also gives a false sense of accomplishment in my opinion. You can go all the way to B2 and most languages, but I would bet money every time on someone who reaches B2 only through Duolingo and somebody who reaches B2 through the immersion as well as close master or memorize.  Languages are not prescriptive sentences like Duolingo makes them out to be, it’s better to be given a set of tools that you can build on with yourself or you can build on within a framework of like six or 7000 sentences, like cloze.

"Be very cautious of WHO is commenting.

People who study Spanish, Italian, French have no business commenting on Duolingo for L1 speakers of English in conjunction with learning hard languages.

I found that with Spanish, you can almost IMMEDIATELY make the jump to materials for native speakers (OK, 50 hours of Listening-Reading exposure to be precise). So yes it is an absolute cowardly waste of time that will suck up endless time when you should already be functional. It's fastest to learn languages like this by ""pretending vocabulary doesn't exist and isn't an obstacle""

But with Korean I tried to make the same leap, . . . even with extensive vocabularies in Chinese and Japanese, and guess what? I really burned myself trying to ""pretend vocabulary doesn't exist and isn't an obstacle"". It's hard AF to get completely foreign words to stick in your head, anything that helps is probably not a waste of time.

"The problem is, there's sort of three camps of Duolingo critics and they're very different in how seriously you should take them.

The first are former Duolingo power users who think the site has changed for the worse in the last five years. This group has a lot of valid criticisms about how the proft incentive has gradually made Duolingo less valuable a resource. The problem is they catastrophise this idea to suggest it no longer contains *any* of the merit it once did.

The second group are people who genuinely think there's some intrinsic failings in Duolingo's methodology that means it doesn't work well. Their arguments vary, sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad, sometimes they're not really about Duolingo specifically but just extensions of the other arguments about learning methods already taking place.

And lastly, there's a very large contingent of people who just don't like that there's a very popular learning app that aims itself at ordinary people rather than language learning nerds, and continues to march on being very successful, with lots of happy users who don't feel obligated to come here and self-aggrandise by talking about CEFR levels and putting little flags in their flair.

Overall, I’d say it’s not reliable by itself. Like you said it’s not helping with speaking.

Result? Dozens of people asking why an adverb doesn’t have a masculine form, expecting “I like this” to translate to “io piaccio questo” or being rightfully confused about the use of “random” 3^rd person verbs in sentences that shouldn’t use them.

"There is no doubt that Duolingo is teaching you the things that it is teaching you. The only issue is whether those are the best things for you to learn, if your goal is understanding Japanese. That is the only criticism I have seen of DL: that it doesn't teach you the right things. That makes sense to me (which doesn't mean it's true), because testing isn't teaching. From what I've read, DL just tests you over and over: it has you translate words and sentences between English and the TL. Testing isn't teaching. 

*I am learning a lot about reading writing grammar*

Really? How are you learning grammar? Did DL provide you with an explanation of Japanese sentence word order, the correct use of GA and WA and O, verb conjugation, classifier words, particles, negation, word omission instead of pronouns, and other very basic things? Or did you figure those things out yourself from sentences you translated?

Smart people can figure out a lot of grammar from sentences they see, but it takes much longer than being taught, and they often reach incorrect conclusions.

"There are more efficient ways, Japanese in particular has a lot of really great textbooks and workbooks, one of the most loved being Genki. I remember also using one called Youkoso in high school.


As someone with not a lot of disposable income I also felt that paying for a private tutor in the early stages of language learning (for me Italian, although I did study Japanese back in high school for a few years) wasn't worth it so I studied Italian on a do at your own time course for a few months before starting with conversation tutoring and for me I believe that was the right call; I was able to start the tutoring already being capable of understanding a lot of what she was saying and while I struggled a lot I did technically have a bunch of grammar knowledge in my head in that first class with her.


But anyway if you would rather do Duolingo for now instead of a textbook (I strongly recommend Genki over it though) I have a few tips for you. First off, remember that the exercises in Duolingo are NOT good enough for your listening. I know it seems like it because every single sentence is voiced and there are those listening exercises, but please believe me as someone who used Duolingo for a year that it's NOT enough. Listening to a podcast or a YouTube video is a completely different beast than hearing one or two sentences at a time. Start listening to the language now as much as possible. Watch YouTube videos, listen to podcasts, watch anime. Don't worry about understanding at first, it's about hearing the melody of the language and letting your brain learn to separate the sounds. It's never too early to start listening, even on day one.


Secondly, be careful of the traps. The streak does not matter. The leagues do not matter. Everyone who starts Duolingo starts with the intention of not caring about this stuff, but it has this funny way of pulling you in. It's a waste of time. The leagues tend to cause you to use the app in ways that don't aid your learning in order to win. And not wanting to lose the streak keeps you using the app past the point of needing to move on from it and devoting time spent on other resources on it instead.


It's possible to come away from Duolingo having learned something, but remember that their prime goal is keeping you on the app for as long as possible and *not* your learning, so don't fall for the traps. It actually serves Duolingo better if you never become fluent because they want to keep you on the app.


So yeah. Remember those things and when it's time to move on, move on. I don't regret starting Italian on Duolingo because it got the ball rolling for me when I didn't know how or where to start and I did learn some basics, but I stayed on the app far too long (a year is WAY too long. A few months maximum, ideally just a few weeks to get the ball rolling.) and I neglected my listening too long.

"> practicing over and over and over again things that need to get cemented into my brain.

I used to think like this until I fully understood that what you are cementing in your brain in this way is not language, but what Bill VanPatten calls ""language-like behavior.""

If you show yourself a picture of an apple and tell yourself ""this is called X, this is called X"" every day, you can cement that into your brain all you want, this affects your brain in a fundamentally different way than when you experience someone calling that thing X in different situations many times over. 

Whether you use the terms explicit learning vs. implicit learning or studying vs. acquiring, these are two fundamentally different ways of knowing. It's not just that one you're aware of consciously and the other you're not. It runs much deeper than that. 

I feel that not knowing this held be back for a long time. Off the top of my head I can recommend [episode 5 of Tea with BVP](https://share.transistor.fm/s/fea9bd6a) or [episode 1 of Conversations About Language Teaching](https://conversationsaboutlanguage.buzzsprout.com/2325378/episodes/14627246-episode-1-comprehensive-comprehensible-input) for something more recent.

After the update, I was thrown somewhere on the path and I didn't know a lot of the words, so I decided to restart and see what the path is all about. Big mistake.  
The first few lessons were the same two sentences over and over. Something like ""He is a doctor"" and ""He is a teacher"", with slight variations. I did like 30 of those lessons and by the life of me, I couldn't tell you what doctor translates to. I always saw the word, didn't remember it, got the first question wrong, and after that I could recognize the Kanji good enough to know that it was doctor, but I didn't truly learn the sign either, so there was no learning effect at all.  
Compared to that, when I started Japanese on Duo, they started you off with just a few Hiragana and the few words you could spell with it. Like ao, aka. It gave you a feel for the writing system and eased you into learning one sign at a time, not form complete sentences....

I'm glad you had a better experience! I'm sure it gets better after the very start, but I couldn't put myself through that torture.

If you're open for tips, I highly recommend Yomu-Yomu. It's an app where you can read or listen to short texts. There are lots of options, like looking up any word in a build-in dictionary, adding any word to your flashcards or toggling whether you see Hiragana over Kanji or not.

This phenomenon is alike to Duolingo, the ranking with peers, the consecutive learning days are the candies.

Once you drop the candy for a single time, you lose all the interest in language learning. (Your dopamine threshold is more depended on the candy instead of the learning per se)

It's not a healthy tool to execute long-term diligent learning. (It's just a dopamine mechanism, random reward is better than fixed reward, it lower our dopamine anticipation to help us reach long-term but steadily positive feedback, which is essential for something takes a length of time)

"I've been using Duo for several years now and here are my observations: 

1. It's fun and a great way to make sure that at the very least you keep using the language every day.

2. What you put into it, you get out of it. If you're just trying to maintain a streak then you aren't going to get very far. There are actually lessons and grammatical explanations that didn't previously exist so I don't know why people are acting like they don't unless they haven't tried it in the last 7 years or something. It's not going to get you fluent (although I've heard Norwegian gets you pretty close). 

3. The higher up lessons are better because there are actual writing exercises where you have to form your own thoughts and express them, and Duo will correct them for you similar to how a teacher does. 

4. Max actually seems pretty great since you can have fake phone conversations and it forces you to talk more. Also further in depth explanations for mistakes. That said I think using chatgpt to have conversations in another language is much cheaper and superior tool. 

5. Don't use Duo alone obviously, but also don't think that a textbook is going to get you speaking the language any better. Textbooks can't force you to talk or show correct pronunciation. Some of the best language learning comes from pure immersion in a country's language, not from somebody painstakingly explaining the ""why's"" of grammar.

A long time ago I found it very helpful for forcing me to use foreign characters but I don't think it would have taught me well enough on its own to understand some of the exercises. Using Duo is like buying that textbook that everyone says is great for learning X. People at a certain level with certain approaches to language may find great usefulness in something that is too easy, too difficult, too detailed, too concise for other learners. One thing about Duo is that it gameifies learning a language. If you're new to language learning having extrinsic rewards may be what you need to get over the first humps.

"I think it's similar to the Suzuki method of teaching music. Less focus on the technical aspects and more on memorisation and repetition. I think those who dislike Duolingo mainly cite one or both of (a) it only takes you so far and is useless as a way to gain fluency; and (b) it seemingly ignores grammar in favour of memorising vocab and short phrases.

I understand these criticisms, but I appreciate Duolingo for what it can do, not what it can't do. It's a great port of entry into languages and does so in a relatively interesting and unimposing way. Before the internet and smart phones, trying to learn a language from books and cassettes alone, without attending classes, was a tall order, which required a lot of dedication.

"I'm certainly one of *those* people that ""hates"" on Duolingo. Here's why:
1. When I started out learning Korean/Mandarin years ago, Duolingo didn't have crap for Eastern Asian languages, and even now compared to languages like Spanish and German, there's barely any content. Literally tested out of it all in 2 hours for Mandarin. Maybe Japanese course has slightly more - and Duolingo is better than nothing I guess, but there's more specific apps out there for ""serious learners""
2. Duolingo has improved a bit over the years from not being totally gamified, and it teaches some grammar and such, but it still has gacha elements to pressure you to pay just to learn - the competitive factor is fine, but the gacha system makes it feel like a ""casual"" game rather than a serious resource.
3. Other than their super popular Spanish, German, etc, other languages just don't have an equal representation for content - especially not anywhere near high beginner or intermediate, and certainly not for Mandarin. And even if it did, the program is structured to satisfy you with games and reviews systems vs speeding through on a dedicated, structured learning track.
4. It's no secret that the chosen content often sounds awkward and unnatural. It's almost hilarious what Duolingo tries to teach you vs what they don't teach you. It might very well be random sentences for it's usefulness, and you can't always count on learning the most common dialogues and useful expressions.
5. Use what you like and what's fun for you but if a learning app (even a free one) doesn't challenge you to advance to the next level- well keep enjoying being a casual learner- nothing wrong with that, but quite frankly if you really want to study with a goal in mind, other than learning random words for fun there's so many other apps out there- someone asks on Reddit what the best app for learning Chinese is every day, keep your eyes open. 
6. Other reasons: whatever the reason, Duolingo doesn't fail; it just doesn't exceed expectations. You're welcome to use it, but it's clearly not designed for ""serious"" learners.",0.035,0.727,0.238,0.9982,Positive

"Hello, ESL teacher, linguist, and fellow language learner here. I made a reddit just to answer your question! 😊

The important thing to know when dealing with language learning apps is none of them are perfect. There is no app out there that will give you the balance you need to fully immerse yourself in a language. Here are the pros and cons of Duolingo: 

Pros: 
• Repetitiveness. Repeating and activities and memorizing phrases is actually great for getting grammar structures and patterns in your head. It can also help with listening and training your ear 
• Vocabulary. Duolingo is great for learning new words. I think it does well, especially with testing you on grammar changes. 
• Alphabets. Duolingo provides a much slower practice when it comes to alphabets which is great for learning the letters. (Writing however is always the best way to learn letters) 
• Free availability. Duolingo offers all languages on the free version and you never have to pay if you don’t want to. 

Cons: 
• Not enough grammar explanations. Duolingo offers revision and memorization tools, therefore they don’t go into explanations. 
• Translation. Duolingo relies on translation a lot of the time which adds another step into the language learning. 
• Lack of cultural knowledge. Grammar is often times tied into culture, especially in a language like Japanese. Often that’s where you find the most errors because they aren’t discussing the cultural elements. For example in the Japanese the question they might pose is アメリカじんですか。(amerika jin desu ka) which is “Are you American?” informally. If you were to actually go to Japan they would ask アメリカのかたですか。(amerika no kata desu ka) which is “Are you American?” politely. And then you might say はいアメリカじんです。(hai, amerika jin desu) “Yes, I’m American.”

No matter how you learn a language, it’s important to add it to your daily life. That is way people don’t learn a lot of languages well in traditional American schools.  

Like I said before, Duolingo is great for revision and practice. However in order to get the next layer, you need to supplement. This could be with another language learning app, a Japanese grammar book, or watching Japanese programs. You have to put the effort and practice.

Unfortuantely, the hate for Duolingo is justified in many ways.

Duolingo expects you indeed to use it for a long time and yet it actively punishes you for doing so, by constantly shifting and changing the course you are on through updates, I think many long learners can relate where your course changes so much and puts you somewhere else, perhaps beond your skill level and now you are absolutely fucking lost and absolutely thrown off.

The hearts system is also incredibly counter-intuitive for studying, you should not be punished by making mistakes by making it so you cannot study anymore, makes no sense, it encourages the user to cheat to retain their streak.

"There's a lot of non-linguists in this community with opinions about stuff answered by linguistic research. 

I am a linguist (grad student so... take it with a grain of salt but I have read the research and taken a graduate level class on second language acquisition) 

Duolingo and some other apps does a couple of unique things like use AI, which can help spontaneous generation of speech, and most importantly, gamification of learning. Gamification is well known to be something that helps people learn in general, and this is also seen with language acquisition. 

Who duolingo and these apps fail to do is something that is really hard to replicate outside of the classroom, which is readily responding to the specific needs of each person in their language acquisition. Researchers simply haven't found a way to replicate this. 

Apps will never be as good as language learning in person in a classroom. BUT they are much more accessible and provide people with motivation to go to an actual classroom. People who are more driven are more likely to learn languages - they might not know their drive or affinity towards learning a language until they try. And they probably won't try it if there are big upfront costs (tuition).  

From my perspective, this is just a really nuanced conversation. There is no ""right"" way to learn a language and is really dependent on a looot of factors that vary from person to person.

Also, I could get gist of online articles in Spanish. Not nuances nor details, but the gift of it.

Clearly I learned something. And yes, I tried the netlix thing for a language I had not done far enough in Duolingo yet and no, the method  was not useable yet.

-------------------------------------

Second thing is, nothing in the article gives remotely believable reasons why duolingo cant help to learn. It seems to just ... dislike the fun parts of Duolingo and having anger over weird sentences. It dislikes that it is not traditional grammar based learning ... but consistent result of that one was student not having useful knowledge. 


Article proposes:

*  ""but flicking through one of those kitsch phrasebooks"" which wont teach you, actually.
* ""listening to a podcast in another language, slowed down to 0.5x speed if necessary"" which works only once your initial knowledge is high enough.
* ""signing up at a second-rate university – and going on a placement abroad"" - kinda incompatible with job, family and costs money.

If you have time and willingness to put in actual effort, you can use more effective methods then Duolingo. I had neither and improved more then I would expect. But, the methods article proposes are not effective, they are just ""traditional"". If they worked, older generations (like mine) would had much better foreign language knowledge then we had.

"I disagree with the writer as they seem to complain about the non learning specific aspects of the company and their strategy. They see themselves as competing with social media for engagement.  They do the funny stuff to get interactions and encourage more use. They want to retain users for the long term to learn. The streak alone isn't a useful measure of how much time someone put into learning either. 

I've had friends feel misled by streaks as well so I get it but it's all about time with the language. A few minutes each day will get you progressing but not quickly.  The writer also ignores how the app is clearly transitioning from sentence and vocab learning to teaching with content. An approach that gets you certainly further and faster. But it all takes time and effort in. 

I see it as one tool in the toolkit and probably the best option of that tool style. I would also recommend further immersion through TV,  movies, books, video games and then also native speaker engagement of some kind through something like hellotalk. Those three combined have propelled me further than anything individually. 

Also, I feel the pain of not knowing something seemingly basic. A few years ago I went to Mexico and realized I could have a conversation with someone but didn't have the reflex muscles built on how to order food. I had to learn and practice that specifically.",0.05,0.804,0.145,0.9779,Positive

"Hello, not long ago the Irish Duolingo course got rid of the native speaker audio recordings and replaced them with an artificial voice which does not have accurate and correct pronunciations in many cases, in accordance with the pronunciation rules of that language. 

Because of this myself and many others have had to tell beginners not to use Duolingo for Irish. 

Is it possible that this decision could be reversed by the Irish Duolingo team? 

It was thought they had rescued the situation years ago when they replaced the original bad recordings with an actual native speaker who had correct pronunciations, but now they once again seem to be going the other direction. 

I understand the attraction for them of the robot speaker, however if they are determined to go in this direction there is only one Irish text to speech resource with accurate pronunciations and that is the one made by the team at Abair.ie",0.014,0.921,0.065,0.8126,Positive

"Thank you for taking the time to post on this subreddit. We appreciate it. 

I enjoyed using Duolingo, both as a free and paid member, during the pandemic—specifically with Norwegian. This course, I would argue, as the best course in Duo. I loved the multiple pop culture references, but also the wonderful grammar practice—word order, making nouns and adjectives singular/plural, making questions, etc. I loved the learning tree of that time—the clear, visible organization of topics. I loved the sentence discussions and the grammar notes. I thought the pace of new vocabulary was just right—enough to be motivating but challenging. 

Now, I find the Duo app unusable. The characters are annoying, and I can’t escape them. The vocab is no longer sorted by topics. Despite paying, I would get lots of annoying prompts: “protect your streak freeze!” “your friend leveled up!” “”join the challenge!” The grammar notes are gone. The pace of new vocab is sooooo slow. It’s not about learning a language anymore—it’s just a game. 

I sometimes wonder if I should learn app-coding, so I could make a Duo alternative, but only as it used to be. 

I guess my question would be: could you offer a serious version of Duo? Even a paid one? One without leagues, without characters—where I can focus on language acquisition without the distractions? Duo used to be good…Now it’s not.",0.049,0.772,0.179,0.9872,Positive
"Certainly the metrics on the use of Duolingo (which languages, etc.) are all accurate. Have there been attempts to discover how useful it was helping people reach their language goals?

My background: I was using Duolingo to learn Italian back in 2014. I was progressing steadily for a couple months, and then I took some time off to actually study Italian for a month. When I came back to the app, I was able to clear the whole tree quite easily, and yet I still had plenty of room to learn Italian better. This left me with the impression that Duolingo, while useful for getting started, may not be a very efficient way to learn. (I also know of many who do their daily lesson, even for years, and yet seem far from comfortable with target language.)

Surely it’s possible that the app has improved in nearly ten years, but it seems like it is still a possible problem: people using the app as a substitute for actually learning.

Edited to clarify: The question might even be, why didn't you ever allow the Portuguese community to make their own course? Per the question another user made me, I should clarify that I did volunteered to do it many years ago but never heard of a reply from Duolingo.

I really struggled to make progress with the tree back in 2018 and gave up on Duolingo. I started back up in January of this year and everything is clicking!! I am now able to communicate at work with Spanish-only customers and it is largely thanks to Duolingo. 

**My main issue with the app, however, is the lack of support for endangered languages.** (**Specifically Hawaiian.)**

Though I love Hawaiian culture, I got a limited, tourist-view of it as a child. I have always wanted to get closer to the culture and speak the language. I find each word a delight. It’s just such a beautiful language!

As you know, Hawaiian is critically endangered (in large part because of American colonialism), and as a result, there are little to no resources online. I would like to learn it on Duolingo but the course is *simply not supported by Duolingo.* By that I mean it was designed entirely by volunteers in the incubation initiative. Once Duolingo went public, it disbanded the incubation and thus stagnated the Hawaiian language course.

It is a good start to a course, but it is only 34 units. Additionally, those units are bare bones. They have poor audio quality, if at all. There are no stories or other features as are standard in the supported languages.

Since then, there appears to be no desire from Duolingo to work on the Hawaiian course. However, there is a loading screen in which Duo brags about preserving Hawaiian (and Navajo, and Navajo is only 7 units).

Finally, there is a lot of talk on Reddit about wanting to try endangered languages, but the consensus has always been that the lack of support makes them unenjoyable. This is true for me as well. While I find the language itself delightful, the clunkiness of Duo’s Hawaiian course makes me frustrated, and then I get irate about Duo’s lack of support for a language I love.

**So I have two questions for you:**

**1) Do you know if there is any behind-the-scenes interest in investing in endangered languages (particularly Hawaiian)?**

**2) is there anything you can personally do to push this agenda forward?**

Taking up Duolingo, particularly with such a foreign sounding tonal language (to me) as Mandarin, appears to be aiding me in learning to hear again with the implants. 

My success in Duolingo this year is of interest to researchers trying to piece together how I can manage this while assimilating these very invasive hearing prostheses.

I hope this all makes sense.

My questions:

Do you have any metrics on the hearing capacity of Duolingo learners?  Do you have deaf participants?

Is there any information or data regarding the efficacy of learning another language in assimilating hearing prostheses?

Do you know of anyone else in the same position as I?

If you have time I would very much appreciate your response.

I’ve been on Duolingo since 2015, with my main language being Korean and then Spanish behind it. I hope to become fluent in many languages as a hobby after obtaining my graduate degree, and am very interested in the development of this app. I enjoy the recent updates, but have a few ideas and speculations.

1) Would there ever be the possibility of a program developed within the app where language learners can not only message, but also verbally practice conversations amongst themselves between users? Not necessarily friends. Just another way to have an immersive language learning experience.

2) The app itself is very user friendly. The lessons are useful, but often filled with words including brand names and other random unnecessary phrases. Especially within the beginner units in Korean, in my experience. Is there some reason for this? In my opinion, I don’t really need to be learning Samsung and McDonald’s before I learn “how are you?” or other similar common phrases.

3) My little sister is becoming fluent in Spanish through the app, and has a current streak which just today hit 125 days. She’s been a regular daily user since January, but she is 16 and got grounded during the summer. Is there a way to appeal streak losses other than paying/utilizing Super Duolingo? This could help motivate users to not give up on their streaks at the first loss.

Thanks for your time.",0.037,0.844,0.119,0.9716,Positive

"During the month of November I challenged myself to finish section 4 of the Spanish course in its entirety, start to finish. Halfway through the month I realized I wasn't going to make it at the pace I was going, despite spending a lot of time on Duo. It felt very demotivating to be working on grammar points I understood without making much progress due to the amount of lessons in a unit and my available time.

I ended up completing my challenge, but only because I started taking the unit tests to skip ahead in content. I do feel like I learned a LOT by doing this and realized I knew more than I thought. I took each unit test one at a time instead of skipping straight to the end. I took each test about once or twice each until I got to around unit 17, and then I usually took anywhere from 3-15 tries, and most of what held me back was vocabulary rather than grammar. If I did more than two tries I would also start doing lessons in the unit normally, and then after a few lessons taking the unit test, and repeating that process until I could pass.

It was a very interesting experience. Generally speaking I don't mind the repetitiveness of the drills and units- it is important to solidifying the things it is trying to teach. I felt more inclined to do lessons properly instead of testing out when I encountered new grammar. But it is definitely frustrating to feel stuck in a unit because I might miss vocabulary I am not familiar with by skipping it and then feeling burnt out and demotivated by constantly drilling the same grammar point over and over. 

Will there be any ability added to be able to test out of a bubble of lessons in a unit? Maybe with exception to the personalized practice/review at the end of a unit? Or even just adding a proper vocabulary list to the grammar notes section? Lesson bubbles tend to be the same handful of lessons over and over and it would be nice if after doing the first that I could have a choice of testing out of that section. And then the grammar notes often include the themes and some of the words from the unit, but I think I personally would enjoy a more definitive vocabulary list supplied with it so I can know if it would be a better use of my time to skip the unit or stick with it.

As well, I actually just mentioned it in a thread on the duolingo sub itself before seeing this thread- I would be very interested in seeing time spent in each individual language (and total) either instead of or in conjunction with xp. I have been using duolingo since 2017 and the xp scaling has varied greatly and is not a very accurate representation of progress. IMO it doesnt have to replace xp scaling, personally I do usually end up playing duo a little longer when I get the x2 potions, but I personally would have more pride in sharing my time spent learning than my xp which is arbitrary and easy to manipulate (I know many a person who doesn't like or use duolingo because they fell into xp grind manipulation instead of actual learning).

For example: I have spent the majority of my time in Spanish, since I got my account and currently have almost 40k xp and am in section 5, but I started Japanese a few months ago and am at 16.5k having just completed section 1. At a glance to me that is incredibly out of balance. I admittedly haven't been using duo 24/7 since 2017, but I have spent WAYYY more time on Spanish than Japanese, and it definitely doesn't feel great to compare them by these numbers.",0.029,0.862,0.108,0.9955,Positive

"There are several courses on Duolingo that deserve special attention, but I wanted to raise a couple of flags regarding the Hebrew course.

Hebrew is the **only** language on Duolingo that (1) does not mark its vowels explicitly **and** (2) has rather poor/incomplete audio. This means that all learners have to guess how words are pronounced, which effectively makes the course **useless** in its current state. What's more, Hebrew is a highly gendered language, one in which verbs are conjugated by gender. The lack of female voice coverage in particular presents a real challenge to those first starting out with the language.

I'm very impressed with Duolingo's voice coverage for Arabic, which like Hebrew, is a gender-inflected language without explicitly marked vowels. Still, the Arabic course marks its vowels, which might be a crutch, but it's far more learner-friendly than the Hebrew course.

I sincerely hope Duolingo is working on a long-term solution.

"Hi Dr. Pajak, many thanks for doing an AMA.

I saw in Duocon that Duolingo is advocating language learning without explicit instruction for grammar -  aka 'learn like a child learns'. Do the studies support that this is the most effective way of learning a language? Or does Duolingo do this for other reasons - aka learners are more likely to carrying on with a language if they don't feel bogged down by learning grammar rules? Would Duolingo's approach be complemented by completing grammar exercises in addition, or is 'learning like a child' the best way to train your brain to think in you target language? 

Any plans on introducing more grammar-focused exercises?

"Dear Dr. Pająk

When I saw Duolingo for the first time at the beginning of 2022 I became immediately fascinated by it because it offered basic courses in many languages. I was looking exactly for that: being able to learn on my mobile device, getting a chance to aquire a vocabulary of 2000-3000 words, basics of grammar, have speaking and listening excersises. Everything was there. Within the following 12 months I completed 6 different courses to the legendary level (to clarify: only one of those languages was new to me, I had some knowledge of the remaining 5). It did help me tremendously. I felt a lot more confident to start speaking these languages during my travels. I did not expect wonders, did not expect becoming fluent “learning 15 min. a day” and Duolingo delivered more than I had expected.

And then it happened. Starting around the end of 2022 Duoling began to remove one by one most of the features that attracted me to the application and kept me a motivaded learner. The worst of all (in my perception) was introducing the “one path” method that forces every single user out of the tens of millions of your users to learn exactly the same way.

Here I pause to ask the first question: what kind of scientific research led you to the conclusion that this learning method will be the best for EVERYBODY? We are speaking here about a situation that the program already had enough flexibility to satisfy different types of learners. The functionality was there. It cost a lot of effort to destroy it. Why deliberately destroy something that was working? I want to stress that I am talking purely about the language learning functionality and not for example financial considerations of what method brings more profit. I would like to hear from you as a language scientist and not a VP of a billion dollar company: what data brought you to the conclusion that the new learning path is the only right way to learn a language?

What is the purpose of Duolingo these days? What is more important to you: allow students to learn as fast as possible (having in mind that learning is actually a chore, you can add some fun factor to it but nothing will replace hard work) or having users amuzed by cartoon characters, engaged by endless competitions but learning little to nothing at the end? Since the radical change to the “one path fits all” there have been many complaints on this forum as well as other places. These complaints are typically discarded with the justification that they come from the “loud minority” while the “vast but silent majority” loves the new style. How do you know that? I believe that Duolingo never talks to its users but solely relies on raw data. How do you know from that data that the new approach is better? Your business figures indicate a steady increase in the number of users – but how do you know it is due to the application teaching the language more efficiently and not to the aggressive marketing measures?

I understand that it is difficult to balance your goals as a scientist with those of a senior manager of a publically traded for-profit company – thank you for your good will to reach out to the learning community.",0.037,0.859,0.104,0.9851,Positive

Also, what are Duo's plans for expansion?  Right now I listen to pimsleur tapes in my car via audible and my company pays for me to study with Busuu.  I will keep paying for duolingo because I love and believe in the company, but it seems like they have missed a couple points of contact.  Psychologically I feel like I can log into busuu any time at work and complete a couple of lessons or book a session with one of their language teachers.  My company has paid for it so that is an inherent recognition that they value me spending time on it.

The Duolingo English Test saw a huge jump in revenue when the pandemic forced institutions to start accepting online proficiency tests. Now Duolingo is looking to expand the business in that direction for the sake of profit and framing it as altruism. This is pretty standard stuff in the tech world but the reason the test is so accessible (read affordable) is that it follows the lead of the app in neglecting writing and speaking - previously they were not graded, and now I think it's done using AI.

Also, von Ahn and the Duolingo team don't seem particularly knowledgeable on current standards. Regarding CEFR, von Ahn has said 'Many native speakers of a language are actually C1 and not C2. C2 is native speaker and also you have a really good command of the language. The way I think about it is kind of Obama-level speaking.' [(From around 6:10 in this video).](https://youtu.be/yi0AfcNlePA?t=371) This is the sort of nonsense you expect to see on this subreddit, not in a prepared speech from the CEO of a company whose product is ostensibly aligned with the CEFR.

But forget about all those sites for a moment. How about you just download a mock paper and do it and see for yourself what level you are...? It's cheap and accessible.

">They're creating a 160-point scale to measure fluency, tested online

They can test level in some way, but they can hardly measure ""fluency"", as it is just one part of your level and it is literaly just about speaking ""fluently"", therefore without many gaps or getting stuck or too incomprehensible. It's not what most people seem to think it is.

Or is it gonna be an online recording tool, that evaluates just speaking? There are such exams, for example Italki has introduced one such evaluating tool. However, I find that it overestimates the ability, and it is seriously damaged by the second part, which is a very low quality grammar test.

I highly doubt a Duolingo test will be even at that level of quality

And if it is meant just as a test for the Duolingo users, then it is a serious overkill to have a 160 point system to evaluate just from 0 to A2, that will just further damage the expectations of newbie learners, who have the badluck to trust Duo too much.

>The English version is already accepted by 4000+ US colleges.

While US universities are famous for excellency in many fields, they are notoriously bad at language teaching.  So, this doesn't tell us anything about the test's quality.

And I somewhat doubt this test will really be accepted by US colleges instead of the current ones, they have zero interest in destroying the testing business. So, what is it accepted for?

"I have a Bachelor's degree in English philology, and before that recieved a C2 ESOL certificate. There are many things which are simply repugnant and greedy about the system and DuoLingo is just the latest snakeoil salesman in town. DL wants to make a fast and cheap way of evaluating people's competencies and does so in an entirely underhanded manner. Many a greedy entity has shown up at the troth of language training & certification looking to have its fill. Cambridge ESOL was the only standard for a time and then came TOEFL, IELTS, and now Duolingo has raised its snout looking for its piece of the pie. What is wrong here is with every new trendy iteration of these tests, the testing becomes shorter in order to quicken the evaluation period of candidates and for less money.
One could argue this isn't optimization its simply sacrificing quality. DL tried to fill a gap which existed in the market and somehow managed to cut down test result evaluation to just 3 days. And it's not because their exercises are better or more efficient. In fact, most of their exercises are the same things done in textbooks, except perhaps some of the listening exercises. The main difference in the test being instead of completely finishing one range of skills and moving on to another, the user is berated with questions from different competencies in a spray and pray fashion, with very limited time. The 'writing' portion is a joke and doesn't really test anything useful like composition or summarizing as it should be tested. This test favors someone like me who has 14+ years of education and 20+ years of use. This gives me a speed edge over 18-year-olds who would have to take it to get into college. Not only that, some of the vocabulary tests also go above what you could rationally expect for general English. I remember one fill-in-the-blanks exercise where the main topic was snake anatomy. Which I doubt is something that is regularly studied in English in any textbook outside of biology textbooks.

Learn vocab, hear natives / read texts and decode words in a sentence that I understood, with one or two words I didn’t know. I learn a lot via context and finding out what words mean.

I was behind in college because all the other students had had language in high school, and I learned to speak a bit of spanish from being immersed in spanish speakers, unfortunately, in texas, where they speak spanglish

He said he was only a postgraduate teaching a class basic Spanish but not once had he ever met anyone.

Find a beginner-friendly book at your library or cheap online and just go for it. Look for a course on YouTube. Look for podcasts.

"I really thought Duolingo was great for scripts/alphabets. I learned hiragana, katakana, Cyrillic, and Pinyin in like a week each, just drilling them on Duolingo. The gamification is great, because those are just mashing your face into them until you memorize it. I'll probably go back to it for more at some point. I just like scripts and being able to phonetically read them. It gives a lot of insight into the languages of the world with only a little study. Plus, many of them have anglicisms that you can pick out if you can just read.

After that, I found it very unhelpful. It gives you the same sentence over and over, so you have a really easy time saying, ""Mrs. Smith's Japanese class is fun!"" but if you actually have to form a new sentence, or interpret a new sentence, you struggle. Also, once you reach a point, it's less about reading a sentence and more about just putting the English words below in the logical order, which is often very easy, especially when the words are, ""Smith, 's, class, Japanese, Mrs., fun, is.""

I'll stand by that it really helped me drill the basics, especially scripts, into my brain, but it falls off pretty steeply afterwards. And that is, unfortunately, the nature of mobile games: rope you into a tight beginning, then have very little content afterward.

Mango Languages has my highest recommendation. I've learned more Japanese there in a few weeks than in a few years of Duolingo.

"To me, the best thing about Duolingo is that it helps me to keep a degree of consistency. I stopped using it for a while back in 2021, and was surprised to find that my French skills actually started to decrease noticeably. The reason is that once Duolingo was gone, my consistency was destroyed from a psychological perspective.



As long as I do at least one lesson a day, I can tell myself that I'm actively studying French. It is then an expectation for me to read a French book or listen to a French podcast or watch a French show, because I'm studying French, so of course I would do those things.


When I have no consistency, it's easy for me to not do those things. It no longer feels like I'm just going to study like I always do, but rather that I'm going to start studying again.


Perhaps it's because I have GAD, but starting something over again is a big mental hurdle for me, because it comes with all sorts of baggage and questions about if I'll manage to keep it up or if I'll fail to be consistent again.

"Your decade comment isn't really relevant because it would take 10+ years to get to fluency using ANY method if all you did was a few minutes per day. 

My views are  simple....
1. It takes over 1,000 hours to feel mildly comfortable freely conversing in a language and consuming native media. 

2. Most people declare that Duolingo stinks after using it 5 minutes a day for a month...which is about 2 hours into that 1000+ hour journey. Even those people who did a lesson a day for a year have only done about 30 cumulative hours of learning. 

3. If using it, it should be one tool in your learning plan. While it is a solid way to practice grammar, it isn't good at teaching or explaining it. If you consume content in your target language and practice speaking with other people, you will learn the language....if you put 1,000+ hours of effort into it. 

It seems like Duolingo attracts all of the people with unbelievably unrealistic expectations. And the people who are at peace with the amount of effort it takes to learn a language rip on Duolingo (and its users) because they don't want to be associated with the group who thinks they'll be fluent in a month.",0.025,0.901,0.074,0.8973,Positive

With that said, I blame her. If she spent time watching Spanish TV, and if she practiced her conversational skills with actual people, she would have been fine. There are HUNDREDS of additional hours of work outside of the app that are needed for basic proficiency in the language.",0.02,0.915,0.065,0.5059,Positive

"Duolingo is arguably one of the best language learning apps out there, but sadly people often misinterpret its purpose. There are two very common misconceptions about it:

1. You only need Duolingo to be fluent.
2. You only need 5 minutes a day to be fluent.

Anyone who is at least mildly serious about language learning knows that these expectations are complete nonesense. But that doesn't mean that Duolingo is bad! It is a TOOL to complement a long and hard process that is language learning. It is there to show you the ropes of your target language and - in case of the well-developed French, Spanish and German courses - to give you a route to follow to build up your skills.

Here is how it should be used in my opinion as a 3rd year university student in language teacher training:

1. Start a unit in Duolingo, and get familiarized with the vocabulary and grammar concepts of that unit by doing the exercises.

2. Research the topics outside the scope of the app using other sources (YouTube, Google, textbooks, private teachers, native speakers etc.). That means that if you learnt about the basics of 'Präteritum' in German, then look up some more thorough guides on the topic. Or if Duolingo taught you family members like 'Mutter, Vater, Bruder, Schwester', why don't you check out how people say other relatives to extend your vocabulary?

3. Clean up the Duolingo unit - legendaries are the best exercises to test your knowledge - and move onto the next one.

With this method, I feel like I'm making very good progress in both the languages I'm learning with Duo, namely French and Russian. It does require a lot of work, obviouly, but there is NO magical language learning method that doesn't.

To sum up, Duolingo is indeed a very useful tool to use, provided that you know how to use it. If you fall for the marketing that says ""become fluent with just 5 minutes a day""...well, you are just stupid, quite frankly. To be fluent is a process that can encompass years and is not achievable with one source only, or without active immersion through media or native speakers.",0.065,0.853,0.082,0.8644,Positive

"The quality of the courses varies so much that no comment on Duolingo can be made as a whole. With this in mind, I am going to make some comments for the Spanish from English course that I have completed:

1. It is very good at building a habit. Conversely, the leagues and mini games are useless, and should be turned off. Same for quests and xp, which unfortunately you're stuck with.

2. I learned a lot, but I supplemented with many other resources, particularly ones explaining grammar and building listening comprehension.

3. The bubble-clicking is useless and teaches nothing. The only way I found value in it was by using a Chrome extension which removes the bubbles and allows typing. 

4. They claim that there is spaced repetition built in, but it doesn't work. There are words I have forgotten because they appeared for a unit and were never seen again. On the other hand, I am glad I never had to see the words for Republicans and Democrats ever again. Internal US politics are of no importance to me. 

5. 15 min a day will teach you a language is a marketing slogan and not a reality. If you do one lesson a day you're lying to yourself. 

6. The recently added ""review grammar topic"" lesson when doing a practice node has potential, but it's badly done: When I am two years in, and on section 7, I don't need to review adjective agreement - it comes naturally with other sentences I have to construct. Giving me ""La niña es cubana"" when I have just dealt with imperfect subjunctive or future perfect is absurd. 

7. The stories should get harder and longer. Using the same format as right in the beginning is not building up difficulty, and therefore more and more useless the further you get. But they are funny and break up the monotony, which is a good thing.

8. The range of vocabulary is good and covers a wide array of topics that you can use to build up on.

beyond that though, it's far from my main learning method (italki) in terms of efficacy. once you get past A2 you start noticing errors, ways they construct things that aren't at all like the spoken language, and realize that the order in which you learn a language is so far removed from how you'd actually speak it's borderline pointless beyond A2

anytime I'm advising people about language learning I always say just use it for introductory vocab and the moment you can introduce yourself at a very basic level (e.g. I am Bob, I'm from New York, I am in school, I also speak English and Papiamento), book a live lesson with a tutor, start watching videos w/subtitles in the TL, start reading, etc.

I'm not competitive and don't like the game-y aspects of it though, feels like it can lead to cheap dopamine hits rather than actual progression in a language. looking at some of the top XP people of all time in duo, I highly doubt they actually know a ton of languages, but instead are just getting points on the same language",0.034,0.919,0.047,0.459,Positive

For Arabic I'm using it purely for the alphabet, and don't plan to consider it useful for actually learning the *language*. But a gamified way to learn the letters is working for me apparently.

2. Having wiktionary open in another tab for ambiguous words. Other tabs in general, really. *More true than ever, in fact, open a new tab, and close Duolingo, as reading a dictionary is more useful now.*
3. So much info was available in the comments, links to blogs and articles that explain exactly what is troubling you. *This was honestly the best feature, but no, if people aren't mindlessly clicking and competing in useless leaderboards, they might actually learn. Perish the thought!*
4. The tips & notes section had amazing explanations without overloading you (for the most part). Eg. ""X is used in situations A, B, and C. There's also situation D... but we'll talk about that in a later skill"". *They were written by the people who designed the courses, so most of the time, you weren't getting a grammar overload.*

When voluntary subscriptions came out, I happily signed up. I got so much for so long without costing me a cent. I was happy to give back, given all I had received.

Getting to B1 on Duolingo will probably take even more than a decade though...

The thing is: I understand why Duolingo does things the way they do. It's hard to keep people motivated to come back and coming back is what makes you actually learn the language. Duolingo really pulls all the tricks you can imagine to achieve this goal and they do it incredibly well. Much better than we do. The only problem is that the rate at which you learn new things is suffering from all of this. Years ago I feel it was better, because you had more autonomy in what you wanted to learn. Ever since they introduced the ""new path"" I've grown to dislike it more and more. But then again, they seem to be more popular than ever, so they must be doing something right.

Duolingo is a tool like any other. It will help you build a habit and learn the basics. But once you've done that, you should immediately move on to things that are intellectually stimulating. Shuffling blocks around is only going to get you really good at shuffling blocks. 

And as an aside, a Duolingo user will always be proud of their streak. But to me, a streak is just a way to recontextualize  how ineffective the learning method of the app is. There isn't an infinite amount of content in the app. There isn't an infinite amount of sentences and grammar.

Also, Duo has free podcasts on Spotify that are GREAT. They're very simple stories with simple vocabulary in the beginning but they are great to use. The podcast(s) tells a portion of the story in the TL and then continues the story in the NL without translating.

"I haven't used it in years, so no idea if the newer changes are good or bad. When I did use it, I felt like it just didn't honestly describe how much it would teach you (but many language learning apps have this flaw), and it sort of implied you'd learn at a normal pace at a few minutes a day. So that's how people used it, and then they'd spend years and wonder why they were still 'beginners.' The reality is that most duolingo courses covered 2000-3000 words (last time I looked with the exception of maybe Spanish and French). That is equivalent to maybe how many words are learned in beginner 1 and 2 classes in college (2 semesters), or 4 classes in a slower paced high school class (4 semesters). But a classroom would also make you practice speaking and writing and help you improve any mistakes, and make you practice reading and listening to more dense materials. 

I think if you go through duolingo as fast as classroom pacing would (1-2 years) or faster, and do things outside of duolingo to practice the 4 skills, then it works fine to learn the beginner level of a language and get close enough to intermediate to go on to intermediate study materials, or reading/watching the language and speaking with people to learn more. But that would look like 30 minutes or more of duolingo a day, to get through the app at that pace, along with 30 minutes to potentially hours of non-duolingo language study time per day such as watching shows, reading graded readers, practicing writing sentences, practicing shadowing audio. I think duolingo can technically get a person to that A2 or just close enough to B1 area to start B1 study materials and activities, it's just the learner will need to practice the 4 skills outside of the app. And the learner will take years, unless they go through the app knowing this material only takes 6 months to 2 years for people to study if they were using a textbook or classroom. 

A lot of people start duolingo thinking it's paced to learn as fast as other materials that teach beginner stuff - but it's paced slow, and encourages smaller study sessions, unless you purposely think about how much time you want it to take to cover the material. And people may start the app thinking they'll be fluent when they're done, only to realize they were not taught enough to be fluent in the course. This second point is a flaw in many language apps, many textbooks and self study books usually at least mention it's only beginner level material when you start. A lot of apps falsely label stuff 'advanced' that's really like... A2 type material for beginners. So it's not a duolingo exclusive problem. And personally... I just felt duolingo went way through slowly through teaching things when I used it. I used to use duolingo and anki at the same time, and in anki I'd be studying maybe 20 sentences in 5 minutes and felt like in duolingo I was only getting through 5 sentences in 5 minutes.

It’s also easy to get carried away with maximizing XP and challenges rather than properly learning the language.

I’m not sure if it’s just not for my learning style or what, but I find it far easier to learn languages when I’m learning words and phrases that are immediately applicable and useful. It seems like you have to use Duolingo for over a year to get to any helpful words and phrases. Sure, maybe it’s “fun” to learn how to say “my pig ate my breakfast”, but that phrase won’t help me navigate through the city, make friends, shop at the grocery store, or book a train ticket. I’ve used it for years and….

"I moved to Portugal a few years ago and I'm slowly learning the language. In January my father booked a flight to come see me in march. Also then he said he is starting Portuguese on duo lingo to see how fast he can learn in the 2 and a half months until his visit. He has the pro version and is very into learning languages on apps, is like his hobby.

When he visited me I was surprised to see that he could very much communicate with my Brazilian boyfriend and all he did was Duolingo lessons. I'm not saying he was fluent, but he understood what my bf was saying in a clear language and could in turn respond with some pause for thinking. He was also using different tenses and spoke with a basic but correct vocabulary. The biggest issue was the pronunciation but that would be normal since he picked up the language very recently.

Honestly, he reached a lever that took me a year to reach (although I wouldn't say I studied very structured, more like immersion). 

So what I learned is that contrary to my preconceived opinions about these apps, they work for very specific purposes, like getting a good base of the language on your own. The gamification feature of the app kept him going even though the most boring parts of learning a language, when you can't really use it yet. 

I don't think Duolingo is a solution for learning the language but it is a big boost when starting. For me, I now have a level of language that outgrew these kinds of apps, but maybe my language learning journey would have been faster, have I picked up the app in the beginning.

"I've been a user of their platform since 2014. Since then, I have witnessed firsthand the degradation and enshittification they have undergone.

Simply put, Duolingo is no longer an educational app. It is a revenue generating app. They ceased to have education as a concern the moment they IPO'd and continue to move further from that ideal daily.

Every single decision since that point has had nothing but profit as the motivator. More and more focus has been applied towards how to get users to spend gems, watch ads, bring friends to the platform...and yet, very little is actually done to improve the content.

Oh wow, sorry, I almost forgot about the ""improvement"" that everybody loved and definitely asked for. AI!

Now instead of having useful forums and real people to explain grammar and vocabulary, you can experience GPT and all of its wonderful hallucinations.

The best part, my absolute favorite, is how I purchased Super with the intention or removing ads. Yet, I still get ads for Duolingo Max. Interesting.

So I wrote to support asking them to point me to ANY point in the ToS or the page describing the Super plan that differentiates between what they call ""first party"" and ""third party"" ads.

I was met with silence. Unsurprisingly. What a great way to treat a paying customer.

This company knowingly lies to its users and attempts to sweep any and all criticism under the rug. The app convinces you that you are learning rather than allowing you to make any meaningful progress. It is an epic fall from grace and it's honestly pathetic considering how great this platform could have been as a champion of free education had they not allowed their avarice to get in the way.

As a professional linguist and a lifetime lover of languages, I wholeheartedly believe at this point that the day Duolingo goes under is going to be a great day not only for language, but for education as a whole.",0.048,0.67,0.282,0.9989,Positive

I think Duolingo is a great free way to learn a lot of vocabulary but it's not great to get you to develop an ear for a language. I supplement with YouTube videos for that. It's less an issue if the language is close to yours I think, like I'm learning Italian right now (I just started) and just off my native French and basic Spanish knowledge, I feel like I can already understand 5-10% of spoken Italian without any training whatsoever, so Duolingo will be fantastic for me to learn this language, I feel like I already hear all the sounds when people talk. 

However I did the entire tree for Swedish and I feel like I can only understand 10% of spoken Swedish. My own accent seemed decent, I spoke to a few Swedish people and they'd reply in Swedish and then I would only get a little of their reply so we would then rapidly switch to English. I consider that a win that they would understand me very well and not reply in English right away. You get the patterns of accents from Duolingo so it's good for speaking decently, but it's too easy to hear when it's just short sentences without any noise and always the same kinds of sentences, it doesn't reproduce real speech. Some languages also have a broader diversity of accents. I feel like if I lived in Sweden and got true immersion, Duolingo would have given me a very solid base from which to grow.

It also works better if you already know more than 1 language, it helps a lot when figuring patterns on your own.

There's also no reason to limit yourself to 1 lesson a day or anything like that, go at your own pace. I did the entire Swedish tree in 2 months, some days only doing a few minutes, other days doing 2-3 hours. 

There is no reason not to try different tools and see what works best for you.",0.027,0.812,0.161,0.9955,Positive

"I think any discussion of Duo or any other language learning product needs to recognize that most people have very unrealistic ideas of what learning a language entails, and most of these people will give up once they realize how much effort it is and how meaningless the idea of ""fluency"" becomes the better you get at a language. These people are by far the biggest market for language learning products, and to make money, the companies have to continue making unrealistic promises to people who aren't serious about learning. 

You can't learn a language using only one method. You need to use different tools for different purposes. Duo is always a useful tool for your arsenal, but it's never good enough by itself. More importantly, the quality of Duo is extremely different from language to language, and you won't know the difference until you already know enough of the language to recognize it. The voice quality in particular is just absurdly bad in most languages, and you won't want to emulate the pronunciation. It's still useful if it keeps you studying every day, but you should definitely grab a dictionary, a textbook or grammar book, and maybe a Pimsleur course, on top of exposing yourself early on to real text and audio in the target language.",0.058,0.862,0.08,0.4954,Positive

"I wanted to jump in to add that I actually got to hear the co-creator/CEO speak recently and found out that Duolingo was originally created by non native English speakers to make language learning more accessible to non native English speakers. The reality that many people outside the western world face is a catch 22: English will provide more mobility, but English classes are typically very expensive so how do they afford it? 

Through Duolingo, those who need to prove their English proficiency can also pay $60 for a language proficiency test that is accepted across the US (and I assume other countries, but I’m more familiar with US). Non-Duolingo English proficiency tests can cost hundreds of dollars and require test takers to go in person.

Like, I’ll see a certain phrase or word order often enough where I’ll start to intuitively understand why it is the way it is. Or if I don’t quite understand it, I can easily lookup somewhere else to make sense of it. I usually have an AI app open and occasionally I’ll post a phrase or sentence I see in Duolingo and have it explain. I’m already halfway there to understanding it because I’ve seen it so many times and the AI explaination will help me get the rest of the way there. I think that works better than just having the app explain outright because I have prior context. I’ve done it the other way and it didn’t really click for me for some things because I just wasn’t familiar with the usage at all.

Although, as an experiment, I did use it exclusively for three months before visiting Portugal. I am pretty solid at Spanish, but I had never studied any Portuguese. After the three months, I was able to order food and get directions while we were there. Admittedly, the similarities with Spanish probably helped a lot.

Some of my favorite things about Duolingo:
- It motivates me to be consistent, where before I would binge study for hours one day, then not study for a week, and wonder my my progress was slow.
- I like the reading/writing/speaking/listening, and variants of each. I have studied languages with both Pimsleur CDs and Rosetta Stone over the years, and while both of those were effective for me, their repetitiveness (at least 20 years ago) did slow me down sometimes.
- They regularly add/update content.
- Stroke order for characters (like hanzi for Mandarin) is SUPER useful!
- Targeted sound practice has really helped me differentiate between sounds without annoying native speakers.

Drawbacks:
- Sometimes the answers are just wrong, though I'm seeing that less and less.
- Some of the weirder sentences get repeated a bit much. In Vietnamese, I had,"" The goat is by the ferris wheel,"" and, ""She is that bee,"" dozens of times before learning how to say left or right.

The closest that they have to a game is match madness which is optional.  

It is not vocabulary only.  It teaches grammar, especially tenses, conjugation, word order, direct vs indirect, reflexive, etc.  Like with the CI method it focuses on exposure to the material more than grammar explanations.  At the same time, it has a pretty big vocabulary over a wide range of topics.  Back when I was in section 6, I got my anniversary report and I had 7,000 words in DuoLingo.  I am in section 8 now and I would guess I am closer to 8,000 words.  Most lessons seem to some some new vocabulary.   

There are plenty of flashcard systems.  DuoLingo is not one although it has some aspects.  It is not a phrase book that teaches you set phrases to memorize.  It is not a grammar book with 80% explanation in English and 20% drill with limited ability to check your work or listen and speak.  

Selecting words instead of typing is common for many apps.  It doesn’t negatively impact your learning although it does help you to remember words and assist you with getting the sentence correct, which is the goal.  Exposure to correct sentences and building correct sentences is what helps you learn.  Additionally, every time I do an exercise, I get at least a few typing questions.  

Multiple studies have found that adults do not stick with language learning unless they are forced to.   The number one predictor of success in learning a language is total hours spent consistently.   DuoLingo, by it’s design has increased that for users.  Secondly, you have to learn vocabulary and grammar while doing, reading, writing, speaking, and listening and DuoLingo does that more than others.  It also has far more content than most while going through a whole course.  

It doesn’t claim like some others that it is everything you need.  It claims that if you do some everyday, you will learn.   And you will.  And guess what, no matter how you want to learn, if you don’t consistently spend a lot of time, you won’t learn a language.  

Should you do more than DuoLingo?   Absolutely.   Read, listen, write, speak, use a grammar book that explains stuff more, join a class or get a tutor.  Those are all recommended by those who actually use it.   

Have people used it to learn successfully?   Absolutely.  And taken exams that prove their level.  Also, knowing many professionals that graduated DLI, DuoLingo is something that they recommended to me and something they use when prepping for their yearly test.",0.024,0.88,0.096,0.9899,Positive

They don't teach anything about the dialects, nothing about grammar rules, and don't teach actual grammar explanations.

"Duo used to be great. The removal of following specific features sucked the soul out of it:

- Comprehensive grammar notes. Now Duo notes are bare bones and looks like that they have increased the number of lessons without any emphasis on progressive learning, something that was much more lucid in their earlier days. 

- Discussion forums: IMO that's the worst decision they made to remove that feature. I left Duo after that happened. Crowdsourcing and discussion based learning is the quintessential way of drawing more users. Now that they don't have it, you don't know **why** you got something wrong, which, in all honesty is the only way to learn a language. 

- Learning: Earlier, I remember Duo could let you rectify your specific weaker areas but now that's not the case. You can get ridiculously easy lessons even after you're midway through the course and the lessons will be completely different from the original topic that was supposed to be covered. 

In general, Duo is a great tool for beginners but has lost its utility as a true language learning tool. It's way too gamified to the point where it feels fabricated when you are trying to do their lessons. It's still free though so there's that 🤷🏽‍♂️",0.06,0.813,0.127,0.9485,Positive
"I have been learning Russian for about a year and a half, after studying both Spanish and French for a total of 4 years in University.  I have an explicit interest in Linguistics and said interest has done wonder in terms of my ability to speak publicly and professionally.  I like to think I've progressed through Russian very quickly, I'm currently reading my second novel (Metro 2033,) though that does include looking up, usually, several words every page.  

I used DuoLingo in the beginning for about 2 months.  What I can say is this: DuoLingo is great at sparking an interest in Language Learning for someone considering it.  DuoLingo will show a new user that the Language they're looking into learnings is more than white noise, and can clue in the user to some of the basic concepts of the Language.  But that's about it.  

DuoLingo had a very good system in place for learning Cyrillic, however, that was not without a lot of self-practice and study.   A lot of watching videos on how to pronounce each letter, how to pronounce words, and a lot of 'homework' of converting English words to Cyrillic script as I walked around my home or workplace.  

I believe that over time, DuoLingo proves that it does not teach the functional grammar of your desired language, and thereby, you will never truly speak it.  Native Speakers spend their entire childhood leading well into adulthood learning and drilling language concepts in school.  A phone app simply cannot accommodate that level of education.  If you pair it with a ton of at-home work and self-study, it may work.  But at that point, there are better options out there.  

It's great to start, but quickly will overstay it's welcome.  You'll feel the pressure to keep using the app but you won't be retaining or learning anything new.  That's because DuoLingo operates off of a very impressive, though deceptive, marketing campaign.  Where DuoLingo pretends it's a language learning app here to help you, and you're actually at fault for not using it because you're not working hard enough.  Like a New Years Resolution.  And if the app still isn't helping?  You're clearly not doing it ENOUGH!!

I have met tons of people who have tried DuoLingo, and then lament about how they gave up.  Because it kills more language learning dreams than it ever helps achieves.  It stinks, and I don't like it.",0.065,0.81,0.125,0.9789,Positive

"I think it depends on what your goals are.

I feel like the loudest voices on here are the people that are trying to learn languages to an advanced level – like reading academic books, etc – and are putting a lot of time into language learning as a hobby. They tend to outgrow Duolingo quickly because it's not really geared for time-intensive study or super high accuracy and skill.

Personally, I just moved to a new country where I don't speak much of the language. I also work and have other hobbies; the language learning is more of a task than something I'm really excited to engage in for long periods of the day. Duolingo hasn't solved the entire language barrier, but it's been helpful for just learning a shallow level of vocabulary in a lot of different areas, so I can do things like read signs or navigate a grocery store without causing total chaos. I think it's great for quickly getting you to that level of like, hamfisted caveman fluency – able to navigate different situations, but not at a high level of accuracy. Realistically that's the level that a lot of people need; if you're traveling or have in-laws who speak another language, you don't necessarily need the textbook version of the language when it's more useful to be able to ask a few basic questions and understand what you're eating for dinner.",0.01,0.854,0.136,0.986,Positive

I've also subscribed to they premium and tried not renewing at one time and I think you don't really need the premium, unless you care about your streak. In fact, I think I prefer using the app more when I was on free (which is why I am no longer renewing after the premium expires).

"It is good for basics but like you said to learn more about your in laws their culture and the language they use daily and why and for it to be a level of spanish you can use in real life and  to learn more about why in that place they will use certain words that maybe will differ from say in spain or mexico or chile or in the domincan republic, spanish speakers always differ from place to place just like english with speakers from the uk or america or australia some basics and rules remain the same some differ because the system, the area, people, culture will influence the language, the people and how the language is spoken with one and other and like you said ''the slang '' always will different from place to place like anywhere and in any language or country its the same thing,  for some reason accents and slang always develop differently in different areas that speak the same language maybe its because its as much about the place, the system, and culture as whole as it is linguistic skill and book learning,(which obviously help) studying a spanish dictionary will obviously help you but the chance you will spend hours everyday for years learning it like school or university students is unlikely and if there isnt a native speaker teaching you or speaking it around you  or many people that will also be very hard to understand how to pronounce certain words and grammar and why certain grammar and words are used and why something will be incorrect or correct if said in real life, for this reason  the most important thing  is you speak to real native speakers also because different accents will effect a non native speakers ability to understand the words you have learnt and follow what is being said which is ultimatly the goal with learning a foreign language, so you need to immerse yourself with the culture and speak to people and if it is possible to live there there is no better way,  its the only way to learn at a level that will be usable in life.



 I was told you have to try to mimick the level of education a child that grows up in that country recieves to be in with a chance of a similar level of understaning their language, speaking, writing listening capabilities that most people would have in that country from going to school for years and their parents and family always speaking in that language around them everyday for years, you have to try and get the same experience to try and learn the same because thats what every person in that place that speaks that language has learnt and been through so they understand the language at that level. Therefore they will be your biggest asset and teacher 

unfortunatly your already years behind them by being a foreign adult its famously harder to learn anything the same as when your a child so the most important thing is to immerse yourself and speak to people that speak the language you want to learn from that particular area, and try and learn by watching tv and films from that place that helps alot and with english subtitles if possible 

but yeah there is always a huge difference in language ability with people who spend time learning in that country watching the tv,studying,working just living the life of being there in that culture and having to just generally live and survive, people who are brave enough to do this always learn the language and culture of that place and how to live in that place alot quicker and fluently than anybody that does it any other way especially from another country where you already speak the language its your mother tongue and you dont push yourself out of your comfort zone or just learn some words for an hour on duolingo occasionally it will not be the same way of learning and it wont stay in your head the same way the little you do learn you wont remember and its because you wont understand properly the meaning , the culture and many other things that go with it, which is all very relevant to the words your saying you will have learnt the words maybe but it hasnt got any context culture or soul to it and then its hard to use it in life 

This is very hard for anybody to learn no matter who you are . i dont think any human has ever become fluent in a language only using that way.

Meanwhile, people on this sub often seem enamored of textbooks (which have probably a much higher failure rate than Duolingo, given how many people joke about taking two years of Spanish in high school and only being able to remember como esta) and Anki, which is designed so poorly you have to watch YouTube tutorials to do anything in it.

"There's three major angles to the Duolingo criticism, and I have different feelings on each one.

On the one hand Duolingo has over time become worse, not necessarily as a method of learning, but as an app. There's a feeling that in recent years it has become overly agressive in its attempt to push you on to the premium service, resulting in ads that are overly frequent and intrusive. At the same time, it has made divisive changes to its community and written resources which have left people who like more traditional learning feeling like it's more and more like a skinner box. Push button, get bell. Personally, I never used the forums or the written material, so it doesn't really seem that different to me, but these are legitimate criticisms.

Then there's the critcism that its quality of material is poor, particularly for languages outside that Anglophone High School classics; French, German, Spanish etc. Partly this is because they clearly use a lot of automatically generated material, and because of the nature of the app, it sometimes will fail you because of its own innacuracies or inability to understand the nuance of potential answers. I think this criticism is, honestly, pretty empty. The nature of using an app like this to learn comes with the inherent cost that nobody's checking every little question. And the nature of languages means that, in my opinion at least, a little bit of inaccurate instruction isn't that harmful. It's often more useful to push forward with a confident and slightly inaccurate take on something than to stop until you're sure you've figured it out. Also, a lot of the people who make these criticisms are, by necessity, more experienced than the kind of people the level of question is aimed at. They're not the best source on how it is as a learning resource.

And finally, there's a lot of gatekeeping about language learning where people like to get possessive. The fact that Duolingo is popular and popular with people outside of language learning circles is a big part of the backlash. It's the ""The Sims isn't a real video game"" principle. If you're not here posting every day about your grind, or know what Anki is, you haven't jumped through the hoops to *deserve* fluency, so we have to say Duolingo won't get you there.

Now, of course, Duolingo isn't perfect. It's marketing is all hype, and I find it way too slow for my tastes, but there's nothing wrong with it. Most of the people who complain about it will recommend Anki in the next breath, despite the fact the methodologically speaking they're almost identical.

Other issues include: the audio is computer generated and sounds unnatural; many of the sentences themselves are unnatural, especially in the lower levels; the content lacks context so it can be difficult to understand nuances in language use; grammar explanation can be lacking; it encourages learning set phrases rather than enabling natural language production; it focuses too much on language output (writing) without enough input (listening/reading) which can foster fossilised errors; it focuses too much on logging on regularly and not enough on quality engagement with the material; it vastly overstates its value in terms of the functional level you can achieve by using it.

"It covers the basics and will get you started, but there is a limit to how far the lessons will take you, and how well you can express yourself in that language when you have completed them. This is true of any language course that doesn't involve a live teacher and spontaneous interaction with native speakers, though.

I took the Polish course beginning in 2019, completed it, and then repeated it from start to finish two more times. Some languages like Polish only have one course and one level of instruction, while others have more. 

Simple speaking exercises are included in some courses, but not all. The Polish course didn't have any. (Instead, you are instructed to repeat the exercises out loud, while working on your own to match the pronunciation that you heard. There was no feedback, though.)

The most popular courses include multiple resources, while others do not. I grew frustrated with reading breathless announcements about great new features that Duolingo was introducing and then seeing none of them being implemented in any of the courses I took.

(The Polish course did, however, spend a good deal of time covering that language's inflection-based grammar, though, which is a tough hurdle to get over for learners who natively speak non-inflected languages that use ""analytic' grammar, like English. It only taught a limited vocabulary though, very simple sentences, no slang words, and only a small handful of idiomatic expressions.)

After multiple top-to-bottom repetitions I was able to breeze right through the Polish course, but I am still unable to understand anything said by a native speaker and I hit a brick wall whenever I see anything written in the language. This is due mainly to my sparse vocabulary, my lack of exposure to conversational Polish, my ignorance of common expressions, and my inability to comprehend anything more than very simple declarative sentences or understand what is being communicated in a paragraph of text or a posted comment that contains more than one or two short sentences. (And the colloquial format and grammar of most online posts and back-and-forth exchanges makes them indecipherable to me.)

In my experience, Duolingo will get you started and help familiarize you with the sound, and to some extent the pace, of the language, but it stops well short of making you conversational in it on anything more than a ""tourist"" level.",0.05,0.857,0.094,0.9653,Positive

- hold conversations with natives socially

- write out the same in a summary paragraph, albeit it won't be perfect but it should have a logical progression as far as writing goes 
- able to follow and understand native news and be able to summarize key points in your own words, including writing it out

Are you able to output the above with relative ease on the spot? At least as a first draft? Or do you even care to be able to do that? That includes using any part of the grammar as needed to communicate your message efficiently? 

See, the above is what one could achieve with 3 years of solid investment using teachers, grammar books, reading, listening widely, and Duolingo can be a supplemental tool that is part of that.

Now I don't know about Russian, but the CEFR time estimate for A1 Spanish is 70-80h, and for A2 150-180h.
Russian is an FSI category IV language, which means it will take about 1.8x the time it takes to learn Spanish, as Spanish is a category I language. With that in mind, extrapolating the Spanish A1 and A2 learning times by 1.8x, it would take up to 144h to reach A1, and 324h to reach A2.

So after 1 year, with these napkin maths, you would need to have been studying for about 25 mins a day for A1 Russian or 55m a day for A2.

My opinion is that most people who shit on tools like duolingo just don't appreciate the amount of time they need to actually invest to be able to get to a speaking level.

Go watch stuff, tiktoks with subtitles or kids shows work great, go to the comments section, use the translator for every word or phrase you don't understand, then do it again and again. For me there isn't a day when I don't use Google translate or Reverso Context. Sometimes I would ask myself how would I say this particular thing in a new language. I try and then I go to Chatgpt and ask him how to say it. It takes time of course but it is the most efficient way for me. Just don't pressure yourself too much into learning it should be fun after all

Russian language is hard even natives can sometimes get lost with basic rules. There is just so much stuff you have to memorize - cases, tenses, word genders, conjugations, exceptions. It is really fine don't let it stop you. Luckily, the Russian internet sector (рунет) is huge you will always find something interesting to learn from.

For Russian in particular, there's a fantastic channel on YouTube called ""Russian Grammar"" which breaks down a lot of common concepts which can be hard to get your head around.

"I did 10 minutes a day on DuoLingo for a couple of years and completed only the first third of the Spanish course (A1) and watched a Spanish series on Netflix with English subtitles. I’ve managed just fine since arriving in Spain and can communicate in any situation (government, friends, school evenings, albeit with obviously very poor Spanish.) Therefore I feel like I learned to speak Spanish with DuoLingo.

However, I think what people misunderstand about DuoLingo, or classes or grammar books or anything else that teaches you the basics, is that it has nothing to do with actually speaking. You need to practice with an online teacher, friend, language exchange or in real situations (if possible for you) to be able to actually speak.

In these cases you start simply memorizing how to say what you expect you will need in a conversation ahead of time, you catch maybe one word of the reply and then switch back to English. But as you get comfortable (with how much you need to ignore that you don’t understand, with their accent, with nerves, etc) the bit of grammar and vocabulary that you picked up from DuoLingo (or classes or whatever) will kick in and help you relatively quickly get to a where you can communicate….BUT this step is far more difficult if you are shy or otherwise struggle to have those first conversations.

"I used Duolingo as a foundation, finished section 2, then stopped because it got too specified and stopped accepting common answers and required the ones with crazy language. For Russian, alongside Duolingo I recommend watching movie dubs in Russian on YouTube. My little pony is generally easy to understand without any subtitles and I’m at a A2-B1 level. Listen to Russian music, they have a lot of more western style music so it’s easy to get in to. You could reply to this with a genre and I could give you some recommendations. It also helps to solidify the vocabulary you use in Duolingo that you don’t understand. For example, I could never remember the word корабль until I started listening to что такое осень, where they use the word a couple times throughout, therefore I got used to the word). You could also go on a chat roulette site or telegram to find ppl to talk with. If you can find people to talk with, there’s generally people willing to talk to you at any level. Especially with Russians, many people will speak easier for you. Even when I was A1, there were people willing to talk with me in basic conversations. If you can, find someone who speaks English and Russian so you can just switch back when you need to. Because of this I speak fluent Rushglish with my bf lol, and often even when we don’t need to we just switch back and forth between each word subconsciously (especially me, he is much better in English so he doesn’t need to, but he understands me fine). Don’t worry about speaking brokenly. If you go on Omegle and match with Russians, the first thing they all say is Hyelloh, I em rasha (hello, I am Russia). Don’t be discouraged if you can’t properly talk with a native yet, I’ve studied a year and a half and make so many mistakes hsha but Russians (in person not always online) are generally very nice and friendly and willing to speak slowly if you ask politely.

Start watching a lot of movies and TV in Russian. There's surely plenty on netflix and on youtube Nickelodeon posts shows in Russian on a channel called Nickelodeon Cyrillic. Another success I've had recently in Spanish is reading graphic novels.

For me now, the words stick more in my memory reading then hearing them , in context.

---   




So use the  twin track approach, while learning the basics on a course .   At the same time, read short , native - level texts about your hobbies/ interests.  Either in your native language , or native level of the target language.  Use a translation program like Google or bing , for an approximate translation. And importantly to hear and map the words in yr head.  Use ai's as reference guides too.




 Reading short native level texts in your area of interest.  Is the foundation you'll build on  , your beach head into the target language .
You'll enjoy because,  your areas of interest are Fun, not a chore.
 For me,  Language learning has to have alot of fun in it .  






This will naturally expose you to pronouns, tenses, common verbs and adjectives, numbers. The frequency and context should help you more easily remember those,  and  adult level words eg ' associated, context ', and words associated with your interests  






 ---   




2a. Also whatever sentence you want to say in English. Use translation programs to tell you  what the Russian sentence would be.    




2b. Then mix the Russian word/s into yr English sentence. You can obey Russian or English sentence structure . Russlish.

"The harder a language is for an English speaker, the less Duolingo will be capable on elaborating. At least that's how I see it.

A very common example of this is Duolingo's Finnish course. Duolingo uses *kirjakieli* (written/formal Finnish) instead of *puhekieli* (colloquial Finnish), which is uses a lot of abbreviations and is the more common one. The problem with Duolingo is that it's sluggish; there's too much content to play but not enough to learn. And this is a problem, especially because besides grammar, you need vocabulary, and that's the biggest hill in language learning. It's way more important than the rules, which have a clear limit unlike vocabulary, so to say.

Your biggest resource is the world, more specifically the Internet. What you need right now is a ton of vocabulary, now that you have a basic idea on how the grammar works, and so my recommendation is listening and reading to Russian content in your case. Translate whatever you don't understand, put on Russian subtitles, and put it to practice in writing and then read out loud, articulate, and mentally play with as much Russian words as you can in an attempt to make sentences.

The only apps I use regularly are Google Translate, Anki and a few language specific ones (Todaii and Shirabe Jisho for Japanese, etc). My self-learning has mostly been benefited from books, Anki, YouTube channels (mainly for conversation and listening), and good website blogs.

"An application cannot teach you anything. It's just a tool. You learned a language as a child without any applications. You can still learn the same way you did as a child. First you were immersed in the language environment, then you started speaking, later you learned to read and finally you learned how to write. This is the easiest way to learn. It doesn't skip any steps.

Language learning applications focus too much on these later skills of reading and writing without a foundation of listening and speaking. I think this is a mistake and leads to the types of issues you are having. We would all rather be illiterate in a language but be able to understand and respond out loud than to have a lot of words and phrases that we can read and write memorized but not be able to use them in a real conversation.

Immersion is the number one thing that children get and adults don't do enough of. Speaking is next. Get our of your comfort zone. Find online content in the target language. Listen to music in the target language. Watch children's stories. Change your phone language. Anythng for immersion. And hold dear any language partners you have to speak with.

"So, first thing to point out, this isn’t peer reviewed. It’s called a white pages paper, and it’s a report prepared by the company. Peer review exists to do quality control, so the paper should be ready very cautiously. 

Some other thoughts:
1.  The peer reviewed ([link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/flan.12600)) study mentions 4th semester. This is significant, as the first four semesters at a US university are generally gen ed classes that all students must take in a language. A major problem with the peer reviewed study is that they’re comparing apples and oranges. Students enrolled in gen ed classes often do not want to learn the language, they are required. Duolingo learners self-select to study the language, so they are already not comparable. Say what you will about duolingo, but if you complete 7 units, you’re motivated to learn the language. Motivation is a fundamental variable in SLA, so it’s not surprising that motivated students learn, despite the subpar method. Also, weirdly enough, they’re using the same citation for both 4th and 5th semesters, so that is a little shady but I don’t have time to dig up the study to see what happened. 

2. Related, stuff like this is why I’ve become much more “do what you enjoy.” Paraphrasing a study from the 1960 by P. Corder, “Given motivation, it is inevitable that someone exposed to the second language will learn.” Any method that provides a non-zero amount of input will work if it motivates/engages students (they enjoy it and think it works). This is likely the key—motivated students make any method work, and these students obviously think Duolingo works. This explains the differential outcomes and opinions on Duo, IMHO. if you don’t like it, it won’t work for you, and if you do like it, it will. It is true that input is the driving force in SLA and more input will generally be more effective (show faster progress over time), that doesn’t preclude other methods working.

3. B1 listening and reading is a low benchmark. If you look at the self-assessment grid [link](https://europass.europa.eu/system/files/2020-05/CEFR%20self-assessment%20grid%20EN.pdf), B1 is basically “understand clear language on daily topics” which is not THAT difficult, especially for English speakers learning Romance. The high level of cognates, especially in written form, help considerably. 

4. They measured in ACTFL and translated to CEFR, and it’s possible that something gets lost in translation. As far as I know, that translation is theoretically motivated, not empirically supported. They looked at the descriptions and aligned them, they didn’t look to see if people who passed the B1 exam were also placed at intermediate low.

I'm just baffled when people on here pretend Duo doesn't work at all. The first quarter of the Duolingo course got me to A2 by itself.

Duolingo covers most of these things... but I'd say to the very low end. So if it's B1 it's just barely touching it. So like.... yes and no. Yes by the barebones definition of some of these categories. You might be able to talk about them, but it won't necessarily be natural or fluid. 

That being said, Duolingo did a lot of the legwork for my own learning. I had been stuck with just grammar guides, dictionaries, and the occasional textbook or flashcard app. I theoretically knew a handful of grammar points but they didn't stick in my head well. So Duo really helped me solidify that grammar point knowledge and helped me build my vocabulary beyond where flashcard apps stopped being effective.

Unfortunately by the time Duo gets too easy and it's time to move on, there's still a rather large gap between it and understanding media. I give Duo a lot of praise, but when it comes down to it I had to bite the bullet and take the leap to get anywhere really useful. After leaving Duo I spent some months painstakingly looking up every word I didn't know, and google translating what I couldn't make heads or tails of.

Now I feel comfortable saying I'm somewhere in the B region. I can understand most things well. everything else is just vocabulary gathering. So it's back to just a dictionary for me.",0.035,0.837,0.128,0.9923,Positive

"It doesn't always work as well as Duolingo likes to think. Even before they switched to the new path and deactivated the forums, there were many people who clearly didn't read the tips and notes yet still struggled with very basic grammatical concepts even beyond the first few units. For example, in the Spanish course, I'd see people asking beginner questions in the forum like ""why is it la casa and not el casa?"", quite far into the course, meaning they were probably just guessing all along, since grammatical gender should be one of the first concepts a Spanish learner should understand. 

This ""implicit learning"" is indeed possible, as young children tend to figure out most grammatical concepts on their own. That being said, just because it's how children learn their native language doesn't necessarily mean it's the best way for adults to learn a second language. First of all, it  takes years before children are speak their native language at a high level. How much longer would it take an adult with a full time job and chores? Second, adults tend to have a bias towards how they think grammar should work based on their native language. For example, if your native language places adjectives before nouns, it will take a while to get used to putting them after nouns in a different language. Toddlers are clean slates, they have no pre-existing biases. 

Many people find grammar explanations to be boring, so that could be part of Duolingo's motivation for having minimalist lessons.

Language nerds and those who want to put in the time for things like complex grammar charts might feel like a course is lacking something by excluding such material, but implicit learning is usually more approachable for the majority of people because they just need to know that phrase X means “I am going to eat.” 

They don’t need to learn the 6+ ways to conjugate that sentence to change person or number. They can learn that later, and with less intimidating charts. For now, just learn that this phrase in aggregate means this thing.

Obviously for people who feel less intimidated by charts and linguistic terminology etc., this approach feels slow or incomplete. Because such people often see the sentence “I am going to eat” and immediately want to know how to inflect it eight ways from Sunday.

"I think Duolingo is actually a bad app. It's not useless by any means, but it's just lacking in a lot of departments. My first Duolingo interaction was German (I apparently have B2 on paper but I'd say I'm somewhere at A2 or low B1) and it was pretty bad. I came in with the expectation of filling in some holes in my knowledge, seeing the language a bit more but it gave me ULTRA simple grammar the entire time, you'd learn maybe 2 words a week, and at my level figuring out the word order with verbs already conjugated is not learning IMO; it's recognising, not understanding. Grammar was my biggest issue and Duolingo failed to deliver.

My other Duolingo interaction was Japanese. I learnt the ""alphabets"" there, and it was pretty okay, a bit too repetitive as in you see a new character, and then you get asked about it 3 or 4 times in a row, you can turn off your brain at that point. That was my first learning experience with Japanese though, so I got a basic grasp of a few things, understood the word order but... that's it. New words basically don't appear, I basically said rice, water, sushi, doctor, lawyer, good, cool, small, big, please over and over again. I don't regret doing that course for a moment, but in the time it takes me to repeat the same stuff on Duolingo for the 420th time I could just open a textbook and actually learn something. It's also a joke that after so much time spent in that app they told me how to say ""I"" (watashi) just as I quit. Not only did they not explain that there are a lot of ""I's"" in Japanese but also showed me the kanji and were like ""私 means I"" and it's like... okay? How do you even read that? TBF they do say it out loud but if this is your introduction to kanji then it raises more questions than it answers.",0.044,0.856,0.1,0.9627,Positive

Implicit learning really doesn't work for me. I picked up Duolingo basically was a way to stop my brain rusting entirely as I can't work any more but need stimulation. I like the chunking in Duolingo and the immediate feedback in lessons but in every language I've tried they start out well enough but rapidly reach a point where a whole bunch of grammatical structures are introduced without being explained and from then on it just becomes overwhelming and frustrating. I now have a three year streak on Duolingo and have done multiple courses but still feel like I just know a bunch of words in a bunch of languages with no real idea of how they fit together or how to speak the language beyond a few stock phrases. I'm seriously considering giving the whole thing up and looking elsewhere for a more rounded offering; though preferable still with the chunking and rapid feedback elements.

~~I'm sorry - and also, too late - to inform you all that this post is a whole bunch of bullshit and lies.~~

~~If you spend some time searching for Duolingo refunds on the internet, the **only** positive results you may see is some people successfully getting back their money from Apple. Even in those cases, it was due to them accidentally rolling over to the new subscribtion period (so automatically got extended by a year), or realizing after a brief time that they made a mistake by subscribing. Once again, it was all through apple.~~

~~Moreover, these changes are miniscule to the path changes a few months ago. Many people were up in arms about them, much more than now, and the outcry on social medias like reddit was huge. You can imagine how many people got their subscribtion refunded by Duolingo then. I'll help: none. What makes you think that now, after a much more minor change compared to the path upgrade, Duolingo would make an exception for this guy? An extremely unlikely thing to happen, and one OP posted zero pictures about, he just said he spammed them consistently and it just magically happened.~~

~~And finally, check the source: OP's activity on reddit. He is an active member of some of the most anti-capitalist subreddits, such as Antiwork. These subs are infamous for being spammed by made-up stories about capitalism being owned. If you are interested in fake texts and messages, where employees had enough, verbally destroy their tyrannical employers, everyone claps, then move onto another job where they get 10 times the salary, then these subreddits are for you.~~

~~Now, put together the puzzle: OP is a very dedicated anti-capitalist to begin with, and a capitalist company just annoyed him. Maybe he genuinely tried to get a refund for his subscription, but if you read stories about others' attempts at this, you'd know that he got shafted as well. So he made up this story about Duo giving him a 50% refund, then shared the e-mail address with you, so you start spamming them for refunds. Basically he tried to con everything into spamming Duolingo for a refund.~~

~~I have to say, I have seen many fake shit on reddit, but not only this one doesn't anger me, but I actually have to tip my hat here. His story did not seem outlandish at first or even second look, and he kept the details very low. I think this is where most fake stories fail: the authors get overzealous. You soon realize that what you are reading is nothing but a fanfiction, where the most dramatic things happen seemingly unprompted, while our protagonist have a zinger for everyone.~~",0.099,0.847,0.054,-0.9763,Negative

"Some people correctly point out that the direct translation pedagogy employed by Duolingo is proven to be one of the lesser effective methods of language learning. It is better to learn to think in your target language than to translate into English all the time. Also, a well-rounded language education cannot be achieved with Duolingo alone.

HOWEVER, unfortunately a lot of the criticism against Duolingo tends to be slightly elitist and comes from people who had better opportunities to learn languages.

If you're trying to learn a language, getting started can be extremely intimidating. If you try to use a standard textbook, your initial progress is going to be slow, sluggish, and discouraging; not to mention that many people simply do not have time to get started using different methods.

But Duolingo changes that. It takes all the would-be anxiety-inducing factors of starting a new language and makes it fun! You can start any language, and the owl and other characters will cheer you on as you go. The lessons build on each other, so you're constantly reinforcing vocabulary. Furthermore, the lessons are relatively short, which allows people without the luxury to spend too much time on it to learn at their own pace.

Also, do you know what the most popular language on Duolingo is? It's not Spanish. It's English. We have to remember that Duolingo is being used by many disadvantaged people because for them they might not have the money or time to invest in learning English a more traditional way. Meanwhile, Duolingo is free and all they need is an internet connection, so for many people it's this or nothing.

Duolingo is constantly panned for not being a legitimate way to achieve proficiency, which is a strange criticism because that was not the intended objective of the app to begin with. The purpose of Duolingo is to get you started. To get you from nothing to something. To provide you with enough foundation in your target language to be able to crack open an intermediate textbook and begin learning at a much faster pace (it's easier to use textbooks once you have a foundation in the language). To give you enough language ability to start conversations with others, which provides excellent learning opportunities.

Furthermore, in addition to having languages like English, Chinese, and Spanish, they also offer endangered languages like Gaelic, Yiddish, Navajo, Hawaiian, etc. Putting those kinds of courses on the app is an extremely noble cause because by merit of just being available will make people curious and inspire them to learn, which helps keep those languages alive.

"So, there are better resources and methods out there (but honestly that's true of a lot of language learning programs. If you enjoy using something and you're consistent with it then that matters more than if the method is ideal). 

Personally, my biggest beef with it is false advertising. Only some of their courses are fully developed (the Spanish and French course for English speakers are the best ones, I think), but one of their big selling points is the sheer number of language courses that are available, and they talk a big game about how they teach minority languages but most of those courses are short or poor quality or both. It's hard to fully endorse Duolingo when the quality of the courses is so variable. The courses that \*are\* high quality are pretty much all majority languages that already have a wealth of other resources to choose from.

That said, it's free, it's easy to do in short bursts, and a lot of people find it enjoyable and easy to stick to. It's definitely not my favorite thing but I use it here and there throughout the day when I have a spare minute or two.

"It doesn't come with enough theory is why I dislike it. That being said, it's very good with offering practice and encouraging people to practice because I think many people underestimate how much language learning is 90% practice and maybe only 10% learning the theory. — Learning grammatical endings from a table doesn't make one gain an intuitive feel for them opposed to having seen them and used them many, many times.

I'll say that it's probably the best mainstream “comprehensible input only” tool there is however and much, much better than the approach some use where they use actual literature and news articles, not designed for actual didactic purposes, and simply look up every word and piece together the meaning and do it long enough to eventually learn the language. It has three big things above that approach:

- The input is appropriate for one's level.
- The system verifies whether one is actually right in one's guess of the meaning. I think people who focus on input-only very and guess together the meaning severely missappreciate how often they are wrong.
- It teaches one the correct translation of idioms.

In particular, with fan-translations of Japanese I've noticed many such translators can clearly more or less read Japanese but sometimes make strange mistakes which suggests they are indeed simply piecing together the meaning largely from the vocabulary, not an intuitive feel of the syntax, and that they literally translate idioms. They clearly understand what it literally says but they fail to appreciate that they are idioms. — Duolingo in particular impressed me with the number of idioms it teaches and the idiomatic translation, not the literal one.",0.062,0.861,0.077,0.6867,Positive

"There's two main reasons why people don't like it:

However, if you're not a language-learning ""power user"" (someone who pours in many hours every day), it's an okay resource for the beginning stages, and also if you're someone who struggles with staying consistent because Duolingo is admittedly easier to stick to than Anki for many people.

EDIT: Further points:

1. The speaking exercises are an UTTER waste of time (it grades it as a pass basically no matter what you say; besides, you really shouldn't be outputting when you have not even internalized the language's phonetic system yet, good luck getting rid of your accent once you reach the C levels in your TL)
2. The fact that it grades your replies and does not let you grade them yourself is another time waster (wow, I've used a synonym it doesn't know and now my reply is graded as wrong and I have to do it again)
3. The whole concept of translating back and forth between your own and your TL is also fundamentally the wrong approach; you're just gonna end up as one of the many people on /r/languagelearning/ asking ""how can I stop translating in my head?""",0.084,0.831,0.085,0.0232,Neutral

All apps are inefficient, they may be okay to pass the time but really you need to extend beyond them to really learn a high level.  Adding to that, they either have to be fun or efficient; you can't have both.  Because of that, many apps dumb down the content, something Duolingo has admitted to.

"I think it's because there are people out there who actually believe using it alone will lead to fluency. It won't.

It does some things very well: the drill and kill method helps reinforce vocabulary and syntax, the gamification can keep otherwise flighty people engaged, and, assuming one types in answers rather than selecting from a list of words, it can help with spelling. As free resources go, that's really not bad. 

The bad comes with the ads taking up nearly as much time as the lessons, the mistakes in the lessons, the lack of any real instruction or explanation, and the less-than-perfect phrasing and less-than-human voices (better than they were, but still bad in my opinion). There's also a lack of extended texts. The stories are a good start, but they never get terribly complex (and what somewhat complex ones were there are now gone). 

The worst thing it does, I think, is suck up time that could be better used. What you described is what Duolingo is best at: getting people with not much time or energy started. I use it during down time or when I want to review some vocab for a specific topic (like, I wanted to talk to my tutor ablut a book I was reading, but I couldn't remember the words for ""plot"" or ""character"" and such, so I did the ""Literature"" section rather than searching up the words. That worked fine. But if I'd only used Duolingo as a study method, I don't think I would have learned enough by now to be able to *read* the book I'm reading or watch the shows I'm watching. 

As a review tool, it's convenient because it's basically premade flashcards. The tradeoff for that convenience is it's hard to find what lesson to study for a specific skill. For example, attributive adjective endings in German get introduced under a lesson called ""moving"" or something like that. If all the lessons were topical, then fine, but there are also lessons just called, ""Grammar 1"" and ""Grammar 2,"" etc., with no clue as to what grammatical topic will be covered. 

My personal compromise is that I *play* Duolingo during downtime or when I want to do a specific review but am feeling lazy, but I don't count it as part of my minimum 90 minutes of study a day. Duolingo is accessible and easy, and I think there's a good chunk of evidence in this sub alone of people dipping their toes into languages with it before becoming serious about study, and that's a good thing. I don't hate Duolingo, but I recognize its flaws, and I think there are better resources for beginners out there for just about every popular language.",0.069,0.786,0.144,0.9889,Positive
"Duolingo is probably the first thing I would suggest to someone who is thinking about learning a language and has never done it before.  The problem I have with it is that it is self-limiting.  It ultimately doesn't take you far, and people will stick with it, carrying on streaks lasting for YEARS, without actually developing true proficiency.  DL is a good start, and a good way to know if you really have the motivation to learn a language.  But if you don't move beyond it at some point it will hold you back.

Duolingo fits in really well with what her needs are, a little bit of language practice she can do anywhere, every day, that she doesn't have to develop and plan while her deadline isn't urgent.

My goals are completely different, I want to comprehend as much as I can as fast as I can because I enjoy the process, so I use large amounts of reading input and I find Duolingo a bit slow and inefficient.

Not providing actual lessons and explanations makes the experience little more than an exercise in memorization. Which would be perfectly fine if you already have a foundation and are just wanting to maintain/learn vocab. But awful if you want to actually learn and understand how and why the grammar works a certain way in that language. E.g. conjugations, declensions, prepositions, etc. I started learning Russian from scratch on DL and, while I could recite any of the number of sentences I’ve learned on Duo, I cannot generate new sentences or express novel thoughts. The latter is something I can do with many of the other languages I’ve learned through formal instruction or even just standalone textbooks. So Duo’s utility is really limited in that way.

I also don’t like all weird sentences they use. The apparent rationale is that they help you better remember the concept being taught.

"Short answer: DL is a glorified game that shoves a bunch of words and sentences down your throat while giving you the false impression of actually learning, while all it does is keeping you hooked/addicted to the F2P/P2W model.

I mean, look at your own experience: take DL away from the equation and it wouldn't have changed much.

DL is a half-passable additional if you're already learning a language in a ""proper"" (ie. structured) way and have 5 minutes to kill and to sorta-kinda revise something.

P.S. The sheer amount of absolute beginners DL-based questions that keep on being asked in language subs are a testament to how crappy the method is.

"I used to not like it for political reasons. I'm a lefty, and I'm not in favour of these trends where tech moguls essentially get free labor by distributing work to enough people that it doesn't feel like work to any one individual.

Duolingo is Luis van Ahn's brainchild. Van Ahn is the same guy who did reCAPTCHA, and both follow the same principle. With reCAPTCHA, users do the manual labor required to improve OCR machine learning (though now it tends to be pictures rather than script). Users don't realize it's labor. They just think it's a security feature for websites and that's all. With Duolingo, the idea was that some portion of learners would do translation exercises. Those translations would be compounded, processed through their machine learning system, and then sold for profit to private customers. An implication of this is that if you did translation exercises for Duolingo back in the day, the texts they gave weren't at all designed to have the learner's interests in mind. They were chunks of texts that private corporations had sent to Duolingo for translation. Their schtick at the beginning was ""translating the internet for free"", but of course it wasn't ""for free"". It was just at prices that severely undercut the translation market and further harmed a market that was already in dire straits, while learners provided free labor without even realizing it.

I think they've changed models since though. Now they just do the normal tech thing and make their money by selling your private info.

I've used duolingo for Japanese and Vietnamese and I will always say that Duolingo is like Wikipedia for learning languages; it's a good starting place but it can't be your only source. 

What I mean is that it's really good if you're starting a language, or you're interested and want to see if you like the language, but after a certain point it will not be enough for you to effectively learn from it. There'll always be a point where you won't learn anymore without another avenue of learning, whether that be a group to study with, a tutor, a speech partner, an actual textbook, or a class at a school. When you are learning a language you need both input (information flowing into you) and output (you using language to produce information), and while DL has lots of input (of varying quality) it has virtually no meaningful chances for outputs; sure, you answer questions, but you don't have a chance to actually produce anything other than a prescribed answer to a question. You need to be able to *talk* to someone in the language, and get constructive feedback from them in order to improve, Duolingo just takes your typed answer to their preset question and tells you a binary ""correct"" or ""incorrect"".

Duolingo is good because the barrier to entry is on the floor.

"Duolingo, IMHO, is fantastic at ingraining to the learner, the daily habit of learning a language. Developing a daily habit is the key to success in any language learning journey.

Sure, Duolingo might not be the best resource to learn a language, but as someone with short attention span , this app has helped me in a lot of ways.

I also like the ability to point out mistakes and read the notes containing questions and comments from other fellow language learners.

The French course is a bit dry and tedious, and not as much fun as my university-level French courses.

I also tried the Swahili and Turkish courses, and also found those to be well done. In any case, it is hard to criticize a free resource. Go enjoy the platform!

"The reason I dislike Duolingo is how it challenges vocabulary and grammar immediately and doesn’t really give you much to work with conversationally. 

I’m currently learning Chinese and attempted to learn Chinese with Duolingo roughly 4-5 years ago. After teaching you basics, like “hello” and whatnot, it has a lesson on numbers. A whole section on just numbers. When I learn a language, my goal is to try and get speaking/texting as soon as possible to be able to communicate with native speakers and properly immerse myself. Knowing how to count to 10 is not going to really help me with my conversational skills. I dropped Chinese after 2 weeks and now for the past month and a half I’ve been serious about it. I’m nearing HSK2 and I didn’t even bother relearning numbers until a couple weeks ago. 

The example sentences are also what bother me. Being able to say “The dog ate the apple” helps me gain knowledge of sentence structure, but that’s not a phrase I will ever need to say. 

For a language like Spanish I use Duo for some vocabulary, however it does not do a good job of teaching proper vocabulary (as in numbers should not be at the very beginning of your vocabulary journey) and sometimes glosses over important grammar rules which you then have to figure out yourself. It’s good for something to maybe work on to the side, but I wouldn’t recommend using it as your main language learning tool.",0.036,0.878,0.086,0.8869,Positive
"It looks to me like bandwagoning where it's just cool to hate on a particular thing for cred. It's the Nickleback of language learning. Duo is useful for persistent engagement, and their algos have been useful in finding blind spots I can't see. I've never used it with the intention for it to be the primary learning tool, and have always expected to use additional books, online sources, Pimsluer, Anki, and immersion to gain proficiency.  


Also, when I see a knockdown of it, quickly followed by a recommendation, it feels like an astroturfed effort to eat away their market share.",0.054,0.762,0.184,0.9231,Positive
"I think there are a few things that drive the hated for it. Part of it is the gamification of learning makes some think that it's a useless toy; an additional part of the hate is likely due to the extraordinary and unreasonable claims (""learn Spanish in just 5 minutes a day!"").   I mean, that's possible if you have 15-20 years...   


Most of the hate seems come from 2 primary groups: 

1) those with limited exposure to it. They've done 10 lessons and can't understand why they're still obsessing over apples, or ""they have a friend who uses it and it sucks""

2) those who have completed a large portion of the the course (or all of it), and claim that it doesn't work.   


Since it's the internet, 95% of people are likely confined to the first group. There are certainly some that fall into the second group, though. If you're using Duo, you need to decide what it is you're trying to accomplish: do you want to start learning a language, or do you want to ""complete the tree"" and post on your Insta that you ""know"" 7 languages.  


It's an important distinction, because it's possible to ""do"" Duo in a way that maximizes progression and finishing ASAP, and minimized learning. I'm using it to learn a language, and as a result I've had really good success with it. That said, I could absolutely be making ""faster"" progress, while learning a lot less.  It's simply a tool, not a magic bullet. Use it in an effective manner and you'll make progress.   


There are some really positive aspects to it: 

* gradual progression in the drills. Starting with picking works and finishing with writing sentences makes a lot of sense
* the algorithmic nature of the repetition helps with learning. It's not as good as it could be, but it's pretty good. Content does seem to target missed answers, while still reviewing stronger content
* it is easy to due in short segments if necessary
* hearing live speakers. IMO, this is absolutely necessary, regardless of which language you're learning

If you want to get the most out of it, I think there are a few things you need to do: 

* read every question in your head, completely. Many times you can view the question and select the words immediately to get to the next question. Don't do that. It's not helping retention
* read every question out loud at least once (ideally, 2-3 times, more if you're stumbling). Yes, it takes time, but the repetition and pronunciation help. 
* don't hover and look for the answers. Looking at the answer sheet constantly doesn't help learning
* don't skip levels. 
* frequency, intensity, duration--in that order. Do it often, concentrate when you're doing it, and try to do a reasonable amount. You're better off doing 20-30 minutes a day 6 days a week than 3 hours a week in one setting. 
* use the desktop version, free is fine. The app seems to suck. Yes, they are different.

Lastly, understand that Duo along isn't going to get you to learn a language. Use other resources concurrently. I'm studying Spanish, and Spanishdict, dreamingspanish, El Pais and Netflix are all part of my routine as well. 

I'm about 3 months in and I'm already at a point where I can travel to Spain and muddle through in Spanish. I've been devoting about 7-10 hours a week to it. Duo has been a key part of it. There are certainly other tools out there, and some may be better. Overall, I'm personally very pleased with how the platform works, and the results I've seen.

People tend to forget that duolingo is FREE. For a free resource, I think it does a pretty good job at getting your feet off the ground and at refreshing a language. I always tell people not to expect anything more from it, I don't think any duolingo courses go beyond A2 though duolingo keeps claiming that their site is ""the best way to learn a language"". I can't tell you how much I disagree with that, because there isn't a single resource that will get you fluent in a language by itself. Yet that's what duolingo implies, plus them ""teaching endangered languages"". I was really excited to start the Navajo course but that.. Idk what that is but it sure isn't worthy of being called a course. So yeah I'm not a huge fan of duolingo's false marketing.

Now I'm already on my 352nd day and I can say that I could hold conversations with some friends who are native Spanish speakers. I'm already super comfortable with writing in Spanish that I don't recall the last time I mispelled a word.

It's not the best tool for everyone, but if you can go in with the mindset of learning patterns, sentence structures and what the words mean, it's a really good tool.

There are more than a few errors, omissions of correct responses or just inconsistent word order issues in the Duolingo study materials, and as of this Spring they stopped having moderated discussions on the correct answers in forums.

I'm starting to hate it. I've invested a tremendous amount of my time with this, daily for over 1600 days this current run, and I'm not feeling any synergy here, just death by a thousand cuts.

German is the DOS version and English is the Apple OS version of language, and there is a good reason why English tends to be spoken on a world wide basis.   Three genders and no logical word order, just all rules based, with some rules overriding other rules........technically a V2 case based language. Ugh.

I can't say that I will recommend Duolingo to anyone at this point.  Maybe if you are in your teens it might work for you, but I'm doubting that being any older than that will result in fluency of any kind.

Can someone more experienced tell me why something like Rosetta Stone is taken seriously but Duolingo is just a game? I think I did a free trial of a few of the paid apps and I didn't see a huge difference between the basic principles they use and what Duolingo does.

My experience is that Duolingo was a huge step in making me fluent in my TL. Maybe some here would say that it was because I didn't limit myself to just Duolingo, but I see it as a natural progression from learning to applying what I learned:

I obsessively played through my Duolingo tree until, at some point, I got bored with the drills and my very next step was to start living my life in my TL. Reading, writing, making friends.

So no, Duolingo itself didn't make me fluent. But I doubt that spending the rest of your life studying your target language on any app ever could. At some point you do need to take your first steps to walk in this new life and break free from your teacher (no matter who or what your teacher is).

"I feel like a lot of times in this discussion people end up talking past each other.  No one whose been learning languages for more than a few months would criticize any resource for not making you fluent, because none does, so anyone arguing this is probably trolling rather than making a serious discussion.

Obviously people can use whatever combination of apps, materials, activities they want.  But one genuine risk to be aware of with Duolingo and other gameified apps is that they motivate you to use the app more than they motivate to improve your language, and also create a false sense of progress.  Its okay if you can turn your Duolingo habit into a language learning habit early in the process, but some people do end up with multi-year streaks with what is a *beginner* resource, or sometimes keep adding languages to keep using Duolingo rather than progressing further.

It also seems like a lot of proponents of Duolingo seem to think Duolingo = The Most Fun Way, and people who criticize it want you to use boring difficult methods only.  For me Duolingo is one of the most boring and least motivating apps, because it uses non-sense sentences rather than interesting content, and uses translation as its core method (a boring traditional method that even many textbook writers have abandoned decades ago).  The Duolingo Stories is a step in the right direction, but these are only available for a few languages, and these kinds of materials are abundantly available outside of Duolingo.

Some people may be more motivated by the gameification and app design than the content of the course which is fine.  But people should realize there are lots of fun methods that are more effective and can often be cheap or free.  Comprehensible Input videos about interesting topics, Apps that let you sentence mine from television and movies, [Listening-Reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/fbd577/listeningreading_an_underutilized_method/) to jump into native materials early with audiobooks and translations.  Not all textbooks are boring either, some textbook writers try to include funny and interesting dialogs for their courses that are informative and effective.

The best methods are always tailored to your goals and interests, so there's no single answer to what should you use instead of Duolingo?  It depends on the language you're learning, what resources are available, and what your goals are, but if you make a post on your dedicated language reddit or search the resources, you may find some materials that are lots of fun and make you learn a lot faster.

If you find Duolingo works, keep at it, just make sure you try other stuff from time to time, in case you don't realize there's some language learning resource/method perfectly suited to your goals and motivations that you may be missing out on.",0.074,0.748,0.177,0.9961,Positive
"my feelings years ago: duolingo sucks. which is fair because it used to be bad.

my feelings now: duolingo is just an app and it's unfair to judge it like that and honestly all language apps kinda suck and are not supposed to be used alone, but relatively duolingo is among the best out there, especially among the free ones, and it's good for retention. **it sucks if you're an intermediate or post beginner learner** wanting to improve, duolingo does literally **zero** for you and i think that's where most of the frustration comes from, but for beginners it's among the best to get you started, and to **RETAIN** what you have learned and at least **remember the basics** like the alphabets/characters, and therefore keep your motivation high. i think duolingo does this best and maybe the **retention rate is even better than anki** because you study by association instead of blind flash cards. especially now that it has been improved a lot to suit CEFR.

my advice is to **start with duolingo first** and try to finish everything there in months and by the end you'll already be primed and ready for other materials, as the basics are already stuck. seriously, i spent like months doing anki and writing down the kanas and kanji and still barely able to retain everything and **almost gave up** because of how time consuming it is, but it took me like a week of duolingo to remember everything because the way they teach you is very engaging, like using words and conversations.

I realized that the courses had ""only"" taught me the grammar, so that was why my Finnish vocabulary was so limited - I had learned how to conjugate words, but not many words to conjugate.

"I think Duolingo is a good tool to learn some basic vocab if you are starting a language from absolute 0 or want to keep the basics fresh. It's easy and unintimitdating to pick it up and learn some words. Serious language learners get frustrated with it because a lot of new learners think that they will become fluent from using Duolingo for 10 minutes a day and don't realize that it's just a tiny sliver of what learning a language requires. 

Duolingo personally does not work for me. I don't find the fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, or put-the-words-in-order exercises engaging at all. I get frustrated with the hearts system. I hate the constant notifications that my streak is about to break, or that I'm falling off the leaderboard. The key for me building a language learning habit was to get rid of Duolingo and find more engaging ways to learn. Once I found comprehensible input for beginners, it was EASY to make a study habit because it was infinitely more rewarding and interesting to read and watch things in my target language.",0.064,0.797,0.139,0.9401,Positive
"I personally don't think Duolingo is fun, in that...

* The animations are slow.
* The app is too flashy.
* The noises are annoying.
* You can't do all the course whenever you want, meaning you have to progress at its pace, not your own, which makes you lose interest.
* At this point, they should be using actual recordings, however low or high quality, rather than inaccurate text-to-speech
* It isn't forgiving; I can't tell you how many times I have had to refrain from throwing my phone into the wall or punching my screen because either I translated something too literally or because I accidentally entered the wrong answer.

That's the worst part about it, TBH, is that you can't hear actual speakers of all ages talking or engaging in conversation with it.
If you want to learn to read the language and never actually use it, sure, Duolingo.
But it is just meaningless letters with no emotion.

Burridge and Stebbins said it best in their book, _For the Love of Language: Intro to Linguistics_, ~“Language isn't writing—the two are not the same.  Every culture has spoken or signed languages, but not every culture has writing.”

I just can't focus with Duolingo.
I get impatient and exit out the tab because even clicking ""next"" is too slow.

Even for flashcards, if I don't write them myself (to practice writing), I use [vocage](https://github.com/proycon/vocage), which is fast and simple.
If I write them, I use a normal peice of notebook paper and just use something similar to the Gold book method.
I write down just the words in the target language.
I go over them.
If I don't understand one instantly or confuse it for another word, I write the translation next to it and cover it up in the future.",0.076,0.854,0.071,0.0636,Positive
"Its a decent starting point. The problem is when people don't use it as a starting point, or treat it as more valuable than it actually is.

It's designed to keep you addicted, to get you to buy premium, and to keep using the app. It's not in their financial interests to get you good at a language. It's in their interests to make you *feel* like you are progressing. (And to make it feel like you need to app to progress.)

Repeating basic sentences, with no context, thousands of times will never get you fluent. It just makes you better at DuoLingo.

The way I would advocate anyone use DuoLingo (if they are serious about language learning) is to:

* read the tips/grammar before each lesson

* only get to level one in each lesson and then move on

* do the stories as soon as you can, and do all of them as soon as they are available

* spend more than the 5-15 min a day they push - it needs to be like an hour a day

Then, once you've completed the whole tree, it's time to start trying to watch/read/listen native content or content aimed at language. You could then continue to use DuoLingo as a 5-15 min daily supplement if you wanted, but it has likely served its purpose of getting you to a basic level of understanding of the language.

You then really need to supplement with a proper grammar refererence for when you have a questions, and some way to actively increase your vocab (making flashcards from words you see in immersion, a textbook with word lists, pre-made word lists for language placement tests, word frequency lists, etc).

DuoLingo alone will get someone to a low base level of language ability, and just barely help you maintain it. The more time spent using Duo is less time available for more productive actions you can do.

As others have mentioned anyway, the key is not too set unreasonable expectations. People dream of nothing better than something free that will solve any problem for you in half a second, and the moment they see Duolingo for some reason they completely forget that ""you get what you pay for"".

Actually in this regard yes, Duolingo is great value for no money. But no, there is no way in hell it will make you a native speaker in a single minute. Nope, never, nuh-uh. Forget that, folks.

And no, success will also not come without a fair bit of effort. You need to work for it and earn it. Period. I mean, I thought that was a lesson everybody learned about everything in life, but maybe I was mistaken.

And finally, Duolingo is just a tool. An entirely automatic tool, built by volunteers and therefore absolutely not perfect. By nature it is constrained to certain possibilities. But when it comes to those it's actually pretty awesome and effective.

Where Duolingo shines is in how it condenses the drudgery of learning grammar and vocabulary into simple activities more focused on pragmatic everyday use of the language, things that you can do for as little as ten minutes a day to keep making progress.

And no, on its own it will absolutely never make you a native speaker. Forget it. But then, deep down, unless you're some kind of Karen, you knew that. And honestly, even the most detailed grammar book on its own wouldn't ever be able to do that.

That's because once you're done with ""the book"", whether this book is an actual single publication or a gamified app, there is absolutely only one way to continue improving: PRACTICE. Actually start practicing before you're done too, because that will help you make progress while you learn. Practicing in real conditions is literally the only way to start picking up on the nuances, the expressions used, the various pronunciation quirks, the pace of the language and how to use it most effectively.

"Duolingo spends $75 million a year on marketing and claims it's ""the world's best way to learn a language"". It is 100% not that.

The much weaker claims by its online advocates are that it's (1) a good introduction to language learning and/or (2) that it's useful as part of a many-pronged approach.

I don't know about (1). I think Duolingo is so focused on addicting you to the app and hacking ways to make you spend more time on it - which is time largely wasted, in my view. I think a ""good introduction"" would give you the basics and then release you to spend time more effectively, not try to trap you with a streak and teach you with a trickle of information that is worlds less efficient than other methods (such as a simple Anki vocab deck).

(2) I find to be objectionable in the same sense that I object to sugary frosted flakes being ""part of a balanced breakfast"". In any meaningful sense, the heavy sugar and carbs of the flakes are not contributing anything to one's nutrition. You'd be better off swapping them out for almost anything else and it would be better for you.

Same with Duolingo. In theory you could use it alongside many other resources, but... why? Even just scrolling TikTok in your target language would be more useful, in my opinion (if you wanted to spend 15 minutes of language learning a day on a ""fun"" activity).",0.015,0.871,0.114,0.9691,Positive

Shortly after that, DuoLingo changed their interface and drove me straight into the hater camp, and here I have been. I recently started a new language and thought I'd give Duo a try just for old times' sake and found their teaching approach totally changed and effective. 

Like my own personal preference about the old interface, people usually hate Duo because it's doesn't *jive* with them, and that's fine. It's still free and effective. The other group of haters, as far as I can tell, are people who expect Duo *alone* to launch them into fluency instead of searching out multiple resources.

1. Explain My Answer: This could address the criticisms that the app doesn't teach or explain grammar. I jump over to ChatGPT for explanations, but having it in the app would be cool. 

2. Video Call:  This week, I started getting prompts to do an AI video call with one of the characters. I'm not exactly sure how it works, but figure it is like a typical AI conversation. It will probably help address concerns about the lack of output practice. 

I think they need more listening practice, though. Listening to those robotic AI voices only helps to a point. I wish you had to listen to a podcast or watch a YouTube video to pass a unit.

The whole concept of ""one correct way"" is a huge barrier to learning how to use a language properly. The more you reinforce it at the start, the harder it is to un-learn it later. Learning vocab is good. Learning that there is ""one correct English translation for each word"" is very bad.

"Duolingo has a use - but it's limited, and can be covered by other resources that go further.  I'm glad it has helped you - but keep in mind all the other things you have been doing as well that contribute: you live in the TL country, you are using it IRL, you are using TL social media.

The arguments against Duolingo are multifold:

1. It is a very gamified app that encourages use of just 5-10 mins (my partner has a 1500 day duolingo streak and wonders why she still can't speak her TL: I calculated her total hours in the TL over that time and it is only about 200 hours, which isn't much when spread over 5 years). So people feel like they are doing a lot, but actually aren't doing very much.
2. The system of gamification is designed to get you ""addicted"" to duolingo, rather than learning the language. It creates an extrinsic motivation that discourages people from going to other resources, lest you lose your streak, miss out on rewards, lose your league place! You are disincentivised from ""moving on"" or ""graduating"" from Duolingo.
3. The learning done is very superficial, and misses out a lot of what is important for language acquisition: lots of input, context-dependent information, listening comprehension (1 word or 1 sentence at a time is not good for long-term acquisition), grammar explanations.
4. Very variable quality per language - I'm sure the German course is okay, many of the other languages it is not so good for.
5. The company behind it is pretty scummy: it has gone from completely free at the point of use, to a freemium model, to a clear premium-driven model, purposefully making its product worse over time for users to incentivise the premium package. Not to mention the lay-off of staff recently in favour of AI automation.
6. Social media commentary around Duolingo Success is kind of weird - like Evan Edinger's video about ""fluent in German in 2 years with Duolingo"" about how he got good at German, but turns out, he wasn't actually fluent, and used LOTS of other resources that aren't Duolingo, but didn't mention them in the video, instead making it look like to get to his level all you need is Duolingo. Language learners dislike this kind of thing, so push back against it. (Edit: please do read Evan's perspective in the comments below, I feel bad for calling him out specifically now :') there are definitely way more egregious examples out there than what is ultimately a rather low level spice take that is ultimately rather reasonable from him.)

IMO the benefit of Duolingo is:

1. Easy and accessible
2. Good intro to a language - I think using Duolingo for a couple weeks while you get a ""feel"" for a language to see if you like it as good, but then after this you are better moving on to other resources.",0.077,0.757,0.166,0.995,Positive

now about the business itself: recently duolingo has laid off MANY of their workers, like almost every single one, and theyre being replaced with ai models. now, i understand the use of ai translation., HOWEVER, using it to take away peoples jobs is completely immoral. not to mention the fact that many of these translations arent going to be very accurate, and since they only have a handful of people left to check those translations, the quality of this app is going to plummet",0.058,0.892,0.051,-0.4746,Negative

However, it's really inadequate at the B1-B2 level.

People get hooked on it and spend hours each week. If they applied other methods or tools, they would likely achieve much better results.

Furthermore, Duolingo has been rolling back on their best features for the last five years. There's a huge list of features that were really beneficial for language learning, but Duolingo replaced them with tools that are more addictive and engaging.**The app's goal is to keep you hooked because that generates money, not to facilitate learning at a good overall pace.**

"Duolingo is fantastic for accessibility. Not everyone lives near a college where they can take a class in their TL, not everyone can find a tutor, not everyone can drop everything and go immerse themselves. Nor afford these things. 

Duolingo isn’t perfect, but when paired with other resources, it’s workable. After one year on Duo Spanish + a podcast + chatting with friends from 2 different Spanish speaking countries, I was conversational. 

But not all Duo’s courses are created equal. The Spanish, French, and German courses are much more well-built and comprehensive than the Russian course. The amount of side-learning you need to do is much higher. A course with a short length is also usually a sign that the course material that IS there is not as thorough. 

Then there’s the time I took a Spanish 2 college course, and learned as much in that six months as I had in the previous two years of Duolingo. But that took time, focus, and money. If you have the time and means, other methods of learning are superior to Duo. But you can’t cram a college class into a smoke break. 

For affordability, accessibility, and convenience, Duo is usually the cornerstone of my language learning attempts. It can’t do everything. And that’s ok!",0.0,0.909,0.091,0.962,Positive

"Because a lot people struggle with the notion that each person has their own learning process, and that there isn't a beaten path to language learning; that it doesn't matter which tool/method you're using, as long as it works for you and it gets you where you want to get. Is Duolingo playing a role on your learning process? Great! Are there better tools? That's up to you to decide, since it depends on what your needs are. That tool that was ideal for someone else, might fail spectacularly if you try to use it. Anki, for example, works like a charm for a lot of people, but if I had to depend on it, I wouldn't have learned French, which I did using Duolingo.

People also have a hard time understanding that how you use a tool like Duolingo matters. Since Duolingo is a popular app, there are a lot of people that use the app, but that aren't really invested in learning a language, so they are taken as examples of how the app isn't good. Positive experiences are dismissed, because they didn't learn using only Duolingo, therefore the app didn't really work, as if it's either 8 or 80: You either learn using only Duolingo or the app doesn't work. The fact that Duolingo is singled out as the thing that didn't work, while none of the other tools used alongside duolingo take the heat is telling.

It's a huge disservice to discourage people to use a tool that might work for them. It's important to point out that duolingo has its limitations, that it will take you only so far (you won't get fluent with Duolingo), and that the app has its disadvantages (excessive gamification), but it's a tool that people can use as effectively as any other tool.

"A couple reasons.   First and foremost is because most of the negativity comes from Reddit and while there are some good things here, it is probably the biggest negative echo chamber there is.  Many live to troll and bash everything.  

Some can’t stand that someone else is finding success by doing something different. They found some modicum of success in the method they used and they think everyone must do the same and they need to test apart anything else.  

The Reddit and YouTube echo chamber for Krashen is huge.  Many say that since Krashen said you only acquire by input, anything else is absolutely ineffective.  So what if history shows that millions and millions learned to high levels of fluency before Krashen made his pronouncement or was even born.  

It doesn’t meet their needs or expectations. Some only want a phrase book for an upcoming trip.  DuoLingo is not a phrase book.  Some want private tutoring or a class and it isn’t that either.  Some want to read all the explanations before doing anything.  DuoLingo teaches by encouraging you to figure things out. Some want it to be strictly in their target language.  Some don’t want to ever be told they are wrong on something.  

Many complain that it doesn’t have forums discussing every question anymore so they leave and go somewhere that has never had forums.  Many complain that the company has courses that aren’t deep enough for the language they want to learn and leave and have to buy a book as no other app covers it.  

They complain that the company charges money for about 5% of users who choose to pay.  But everyone gets a full course for free and almost nothing else does.  

Can there be improvements?   Sure.  But they have more content than most, more languages, does all four strands which most don’t.  

Is it really ineffective and slow?   No.  It is better than university classes according to studies by universities. Another popular CI approach talks about how you will be better after spending 3 times as much time.  Can you pass B1 in Spanish with DL being your primary tool?  Yes, since people have done it without even finishing the course.  Can you have conversations after going through the course?  Absolutely.  

Why did I go to DuoLingo?   Because a DLI graduate recommended it.  Someone with 16 years experience as a professional linguist responsible for developing others as linguists. Knowing several DLI graduates, I have been told that most of them have used it to prepare for their yearly assessment.",0.048,0.847,0.105,0.981,Positive

"I don't understand some of the complaints here about Duolingo. I've been using it (Spanish ) for a couple of months and I've put probably 35 hours in at the A1 level. At this level it doesn't just teach vocabulary, it also teaches sentence structure  and verb conjugation. I'm quite sure they're going to come to more complex things in the higher levels. There is a certain amount of ear training.  You actually have to write sentences so it's not simply word identification.  Yes, there's quite a bit of repetition but that's what makes things stick. The vocabulary I'm getting with DL is vocabulary that I own. 

In the Spanish course they have grammar tips. They don't really teach you the grammar didactically, they teach it to you by exposure. After a little while things just start to sound right. 

I also find it extremely valuable to have a guided process. If it's up to me I just jump around from this thing to that. This course builds on itself. 

Further, people complain about the gamification and the extrinsic motivation. I see this is a plus. It keeps me engaged in learning longer and not giving up than I otherwise would. So bring on extrinsic motivation. Learning a language is a slog and I'll take all the motivation I can get.  People complain that some people are all about streaks and experience points... These people are probably not that interested in learning the language if that's all they care about. That's on the student, not the app.

I also had a pretty negative impression of it for the first couple of weeks, but when I got past the initial boring and slow lessons, I started to see how good a learning tool it is.

People complain about sitting through ads? Well that's optional. Pay for the course. Is the price of a couple of textbooks. 

People complain that it doesn't provide absolutely everything one needs? Well what does? Maybe they're complaining about the way the course is marketed, but that's a critique of the marketing, not a critique of the course itself. 

I don't plan to use it as my only learning tool. I also listen to podcasts, do spaced repetition, vocabulary flashcards, read books, listen to music, go to Mexico, mumble out loud to myself in Spanish, read a grammar book, and soon I'll be doing a two week intensive class. 

I haven't tried the other programs people mentioned here like busuu so I can't compare it, and I don't know how well it deals with the higher levels.

"i liked the old Duolingo but they've removed all of the helpful features and now its and unfortunately long path that teaches you almost nothing each lesson. it's so slow that I stopped using it. sometimes for fun ill take the test to skip sections as practice, but that's the only useful thing left that it does. 90% of questions are just click the bubbles or match the word pairs, which don't help with recognition or with reproduction of the word. You used to be able to forcibly turn on keyboard mode and get rid of the bubbles but now you can't. there used to be a forum where people would discuss the sentence after you got it right/wrong and you'd learn a lot from the people there. Used to be more grammar notes. All in all, the app has gone downhill significantly. it's better for than most of its free competitors, but its paid ones are miles ahead. And even among the free, anki is already better at teaching you a list of words with sentence examples and no grammar tips",0.069,0.774,0.157,0.9636,Positive

That said, if you’re improving with Duolingo then by all means continue using it. You will hit a wall at some point, because you will need to draw upon other modalities to achieve fluency if that is your goal.

"I am not some language expert by any means, but once it comes to learning languages that have very little similarity to English or aren’t Romance languages or common European languages, it loses a lot of points. There are grammatical structures in those other languages that do not exist in English or other Latin-based languages that it fails to explain and it focuses on just making you memorize conjugations/cases instead of explaining them in the best way possible, and the only reason I’ve understood how those constructs work is because I am bilingual and have a second point of reference for grammar, or because I do outside research about the language and look at help forums online for clarification. Idk. Maybe that’s why a lot of people that I’ve known who tried to learn a language like Korean (that works WAY differently with grammar) in it have given up when it comes to practical application.

I think Duolingo is a fine resource for practice as long as it’s not the only way that one is learning. I think that anyone trying to learn any language should practice verb conjugation, sentence stricture, tenses etc on their own through other resources so that they have a firm grip on grammar and know how to manipulate a sentence or word to fit what they’re trying to say. Duolingo seems to repeat practice sentences that accompany specific units instead of providing room for the user to play around with the language and form connections about what works and what doesn’t. Especially if someone is learning a language that is very different from their native language, they should definitely look for outside resources. 

Definitely make it a point to look at websites online that go into depth about grammar, irregular cases and especially, coloquial language. Duolingo teaches the “formal” version of the language and some people struggle to understand a real life conversation because of that. I think you have to pay lingots to learn idiomatic speech in the language, unless they removed that feature.",0.04,0.86,0.1,0.9726,Positive

"I think there is a better question to ask here.  As others have pointed out, Duo is not a phrasebook to aid you in your travels.  But what should it introduce, if not man, woman, eat, drink?

The problem with introducing those words is that it starts you out on studying ""about"" a language.  ""Here's how it works, this is what a sentence looks like.""  It *can* be helpful to know how the language looks, but it isn't how people learn to speak, how they learn the language itself.

Instead of helping people learn about the language, it should help people communicate.

* I am
* I want
* I need
* I like

All of these, + infinitive, is how we structure many of our sentences when we have only beginning abilities in a language.  Think about it, no one walks down the street and thinks, ""The man is drinking coffee.  The woman is carrying a bag.""  They think, ""I am hungry.  I want something to eat.  I need to find a restaurant.  I like coffee and croissants.""

The next things people need to begin in a language are questions.  Who, what, where, when, how... for ""it"" and ""you"" forms of verbs.

* Where is the ...?
* How do you ...?
* Where are you from?
* What do you... like/want/do/think?

If you covered all of those, plus some adjectives like ""hungry, happy, sad, angry, curious"", and infinitives/ bare infinitives, ""eat, drink, do, want, think, have, go"", you could have a 10 minute conversation.  You might need to look up some nouns and adjectives, but you could talk about so many things.  (Asking questions is very hard in English, but for many languages it is much simpler).

But instead, we get this app where you learn ""about"" the language.  Which is why people make reels of them trying to make basic communication in a foreign language (not just ""phrasebook"" items either), and they joke about how they're in a cafe and someone starts talking to them, and all they can say is, ""The man drinks cafe.  The woman eats a croissant."" and they feel helpless because they don't actually have any communicative skills in the language, only knowledge about it.

So in sum, I think they question should be, why doesn't Duolingo teach us how to communicate in the language, instead of these ""beginner sentences"" that it gives us.",0.047,0.846,0.107,0.9669,Positive

Also grammatical gender, which interacts with mutations. Duo Welsh holds off on numbers and colors for quite a while to let new learners get a solid footing.

"Mostly teaching syntax in a passive way.  I don’t like Duolingo, but I appreciate the barebones structure it gives you.

Or if you learn the verb ‘to like’ you can make a guess and switch the verbs to say I like apples.  

Basically, learning Hello doesn’t subliminally teach you thousands of sentence combinations.  I agree that it’s weird that they try to do it passively, all language resources tend to try to teach it passively.  For a first time learner (and my own preference) I think it’s better that they let you know the goal of learning random shit, otherwise the learner will feel how you do.

##Why does everyone hate Duolingo / is Duolingo good?

Duolingo spends $75 million a year on marketing and claims it's ""the world's best way to learn a language"". It is 100% not that.

The much weaker claims by its online advocates are that it's (1) a good introduction to language learning and/or (2) that it's useful as part of a many-pronged approach.

I don't know about (1). I think Duolingo is so focused on addicting you to the app and hacking ways to make you spend more time on it - which is time largely wasted, in my view. I think a ""good introduction"" would give you the basics and then release you to spend time more effectively, not try to trap you with a streak and teach you with a trickle of information that is worlds less efficient than other methods (such as a simple Anki vocab deck).

(2) I find to be objectionable in the same sense that I object to sugary frosted flakes being ""part of a balanced breakfast"". In any meaningful sense, the heavy sugar and carbs of the flakes are not contributing anything to one's nutrition. You'd be better off swapping them out for almost anything else and it would be better for you.

Same with Duolingo. In theory you could use it alongside many other resources, but... why? Even just scrolling TikTok in your target language would be more useful, in my opinion (if you wanted to spend 15 minutes of language learning a day on a ""fun"" activity).",0.022,0.863,0.115,0.9696,Positive

For a language like German, it actually hinders your development as it doesn't present the nouns with their articles. You could spend hours doing word matches, but you'd learn nothing as you can't use those words properly without knowing their gender. As others have also mentioned the business model is built on keeping you engaged with the app, which tends to pull your attention away from actually learning your language towards getting high scores on the leaderboard. Doing stuff like reviewing lessons you completed might help reinforce concepts you are weak on, but the app doesn't reward you for doing that. It does however reward you for mashing out the much easier timed mini-games for large amounts of XP.

That said I do think Duo has it's benfits but you need to be studying elsewhere and actually using your language. I guarantee your friend gets more from a few minutes of talking to your Japanese friend then they get from hours of Duolingo.",0.05,0.808,0.142,0.9726,Positive

"I think Duolingo is good at some things, not so good at others, and it also depends on the language you’re learning. 

For example, I finished the entire Arabic course, went to Egypt, amazed everyone I met with my spoken Arabic…. and couldn’t understand a single word they said back to me. Turns out real people don’t sound like Duolingo when they speak. Who knew! 🤪 And turns out the hours I spent on Duolingo only served to help me memorize all the sentences in Duolingo’s database. While numerous, they don’t even come close to covering the entire spectrum of what a real person might say to me. To be conversational, I needed way more listening practice than Duolingo provided. 

Another example. I finished the Indonesian course, went to Indonesia, and could carry on a conversation on government policies with a very patient native speaker speaking slowly. But I was lost when trying to buy food, coz they were trying to tell me something was “sold out” and I wasn’t taught that word. Duolingo has a strange system of teaching you rather obscure words (at the later levels) that barely make it into conversations, and omitting some very frequent words altogether. I believe it’d be better to learn, say, the 1000 most frequently used words in the language. 

I’m told the Spanish and French courses in Duolingo are much superior to the Asian languages. For one thing, they’re much longer so I assume one learns more. But I haven’t done the European languages so I don’t have first hand experience. 

I also think that Duolingo is good at getting me to speak the language, especially since I use the dictation/microphone feature to answer questions instead of typing. After repeating the same sentence tens of times, I get pretty good at saying it unhesitatingly. I also have to make sure my pronunciation is on point before my phone can transcribe what I’m saying correctly. That helps my pronunciation a lot. 

The gamification feature of Duolingo may help or hurt, depending on your inclinations. It could help motivate you to get in a lesson or two (or ten) everyday. Or it could lead you to repeat easy lessons hundreds of times just to beat someone on the leaderboard. ",0.028,0.84,0.133,0.9919,Positive

"Duolingo Defense Rant: This topic comes up frequently enough that I figured I would save this response in my Notes app and post as applicable. 

TL;DR: Language learning is a long process and if Duolingo has helped you in that process and motivates you continue to do so. Duolingo is not without flaws, but in some languages they have seen success. If it didn’t for you continue to use your other methods because language learning is your journey. 

Before getting started it needs to be acknowledged that Duolingo is an app that teaches a language but at a cost. That cost is either you paying or ads. In addition to that it claims to be the best method which to me is irrelevant. Whether it is or isn’t (most likely isn’t) is entirely up to you. But businesses have been claiming this since forever thats why the “Best Cup of Coffee” joke in Elf was funny. 

The best singular method for learning a language will always be immersion or comprehensible input (CI). It’s how you learned your first language and maybe second language and studies have shown your brain is actually better at it as an adult you are just impatient. If you are looking for a single method Duolingo will never get you fully there. The best method will always be multiple methods. Duolingo is a good spaced repetition tool but you can also find that on Anki. So pick what suits you.

Duolingo is entirely course dependent. Its best courses are English, Spanish and French. As you get to more unique or complex languages Duo is worse because it just hasn’t caught up yet. So your opinion may be based in the language you are learning from. 

The biggest pet peeve of mine is “efficient”. Mostly because I have never seen any studies on efficiency of learning a language so my assumption is the claims are anecdotal and then re-enforced by the hive mind. That said the reason given for not efficient is the repetition. Which personally I think is needed to re-enforce words/ concepts from maybe a month ago or longer. Again, there are other ways to re-enforce these concepts specifically Anki again but personally I struggled to stay motivated with Anki so I continued Duo.

At the end of the day a varied approach is probably the best way to learn a language and Duo is a tool to do that. If you don’t want to use it in your tool box its totally fine but the constant discussions here on it are equally repetitive and honestly just let people learn their way without bashing!",0.034,0.83,0.135,0.9952,Positive

If you're learning European languages though I'd recommend Paul Noble's audio courses. You can pick them up off most audio stores like Amazon Kindle or Apple Books for under £20.

Enjoyment is a poor measure of efficiency: you can enjoy a useless resource. If you like games, you'll probably love Duolingo, it's strongly gamified and can be quite addictive.

I think people expect too much from the app. They need to realize it won't replace things like immersion and ACTUAL use – speaking to people in your target language, reading books, watching shows, listening to music in your target language. An app on your phone won't do that for you.

I am not fluent in any of the languages I've been using Duolingo for but that's not because Duolingo is bad. I have also quit and restarted my learning journey a few times and what I've noticed is that if you use Duolingo consistently for a few months and stop. You don't realize how much you learned before until you come back a month or two later and can't get through any of your old lessons lol

That said, one thing that has been missing for me with Duolingo is a way to capture lesson notes.

\--- Enter a plug of my language notes app ---

Well, I've attempted to solve this problem by making a notes app for language learning – it's called Duory and it's [in the iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duory-notes-app-for-duolingo/id6504098229) 

Still super early but it's basically a notes app with additional bells and whistles for language learner. Includes the ability to add inline phrases within a note. You can then translate, add romanization or kana to it and even record or add audio.

Current features include:

* In-app Translation: Ability to add and translate phrases in your notes
* Romanization of non-Latin phrases 
* Hiragana and Romaji support for Japanese phrases.
* Add audio clips to phrases, create playlists, and control playback from the Lock Screen.
* Customize playback order, loop phrases for repetition,
* Practice mode in the player adds pauses between each recording and prompts you to repeat each phrase.
* Browse words you’ve learned from your notes.
* Special note type for journaling in a target language (basically with keyboard suggestions tailored to the language in iOS)
* Ability to capture phrases directly from Duolingo, images, or documents (by sharing to the app).
* Widget that shows recently added phrases.

(Heads-up – it's a freemium app with subscription plans and you can check out the premium features with 7 day trial)

I am working on bringing it to Mac soon (fingers crossed)

>The  results  of  this  review  revealed  that  overall  research  surrounding  Duolingo  is  design-focused,  non-probability,  and  quantitative  in  nature,  with  pre-  and  post-test  and  questionnaire  data  being  the  dominant  choice  of  data  collection  methods.  The  USA  was  the  most  frequent  location  for  Duolingo  research,  and  English  was  the  most  common  target  language;  however,  some  studies  did  not  explicitly  state  a  target  language.  Most  categories,  in  fact,  contained  several  studies  that  did  not  state  or  were  unclear  regarding  theoretical  frameworks,  sample  characteristics,  etc.  (see  Appendix 3).  As  Shadiev  et  al.  (2020)  point  out,  researchers  need  to  be  as  clear  and  descriptive  as  possible  because  readers  require  essential  context-specific  information  to  better  design  their  own  research  and  practice.  Without  clarity,  evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  Duolingo,  and  therefore  gamification  in  MALL,  becomes  significantly  more  complex  (Golonka  et  al.,  2014).   
  
>  
>We  expected  that  literature  related  to  Duolingo  would  measure  the  learning  outcomes  and  contextual  understandings  of  language  that  learners  achieve  from  using  a  gamified  platform;  however,  the  focus  was  on  the  creation  of  tools  rather  than  the  understanding  of  human  agency  associated  with  the  use  of  these  tools.  Habermas  (2006)  noted  that  tools  are  but  one  aspect  of  technology.  The  way  in  which  we  direct  our  agency  to  gain  knowledge  using  technology  needs  further  inquiry  to  understand  the  impli-cations  that  such  mediating  tools  have  for  our  learning.  It  is  important  to  start  asking  ‘how’  and  ‘why’  questions  as  opposed  to  (or  at  least  in  con-junction  with)  conducting  ‘Does  Duolingo...?’  types  of  inquiries.  At  the  same  time,  the  current  evidence  about  the  latter  type  of  questions  is  limited  at  best  due  to  lack  of  controlling  for  demographic  and  background  vari-ables,  describing  the  study  context,  limited  sample  sizes,  and  non-probability  sampling.  Understanding  the  ‘Does...?’  using  methodologically  sound  approaches  is  an  essential  first  step,  but  it  should  be  followed  up  by  asking  deeper,  critical  questions  about  the  learning  process  mediated  by  Duolingo,  its  design  and  use  in  the  classroom  –  while  considering  the  differential  impact  of  learners’  individual  differences.  While  random  sampling  is  often  prohibitive  due  to  its  time  and  financial  requirements,  recruiting  larger  samples  and  describing  sample  characteristics  and  study  context  can  be  a  big  step  forward  in  obtaining  more  generalizable  and  accurate  results.

The  only  feature  of  Duolingo  rooted  in  the  sociocultural  view  of  language  learning  –  discussion  forums  –  was  barely  mentioned  in  only  few  articles,  and  the  platform  was  used  ‘as  is’  instead  of  incorporating  it  into  larger  contextual  activities.  While  technology  design  creates  certain  constraints  and  shapes  the  learning  setting,  it  does  not  have  to  be  the  sole  factor  dictating  how we  use  it  (Glassman,  2016).  Therefore,  experimental  studies  can  focus  on   using   the   platform   in   communicative   and   social   ways,   and   design-focused  studies  can  highlight  potential  activities  conducive  to  such  integrations  and  investigate  how  design  and  gamification  elements  can  support  it.",0.027,0.896,0.077,0.9855,Positive

You then move on to Language Transfer/Dreaming In spanish then reading then italki for 3 days a week.  In 10 years you will be a C2! Lolzzzz,0.046,0.917,0.037,-0.1593,Negative

"I was actually thinking...for an *app*, it would be hard to design a better one (obviously immersion works much better for some (most?) people).

And why is that? Because other apps either only do the ""select tiles"" exercises, only ask you to enter one/a few words (which is, imo, useless), or, like Duolingo, allow you to enter sentences but...

Only Duo has engaged enough (unfortunately unpaid, AFAIK) people to submit and review enough sentences that they have basically covered most of the ways you could phrase these sentences (excluding very creative ways of phrasing them)... yes, back when DL still had comments, there were many people complaining about it not accepting their particular way of phrasing things, BUT! many times I noticed mistakes in the way they had phrased the sentences (and that is with my non-native language level).

The only way I could see an *app* being better at developing language skills is if AI became so good that it ACTUALLY were good at detecting errors and correcting you...which I think will take time.

"Anecdotally of course: I’m from Canada, where we’re supposed to learn French from kindergarten to grade 9. In reality my shitty Catholic school went over the words for colours ten times for ten years, and then I got to grade nine and realized the public school kids could actually speak french and I was expected to as well.

I scraped out of that class with a lucky D-, and I’m typically a good student. That was also when I decided to learn french out of spite, for personal reasons.

I exclusively used Duolingo, finishing the course within a year. I couldn’t think in the language, and my speaking skills sucked, so I didn’t go further. I did the bare minimum for the next year to keep my streak, and then I dropped it entirely. 

Another year goes by, I’m in grade 12 now. My friend in French immersion tries to initiate a conversation in French. I haven’t really studied French for two years, and that was only Duolingo, but suddenly- it clicks. I’m speaking French! I’m thinking in French! It all makes sense! I just had to let it stew for a while, but now I’ve got it.

My friend writes some French poetry, and she likes me accent so much that she has me read it. I worked hard on my accent, even if my ad-hoc speaking skills are shit, and the recording is good enough for her.

Fast forward to this year (three years later). I take a summer university class in French, to improve my listening and speaking skills. It lasts six weeks, and at the end there’s an oral exam. We talk about the economy, my thesis, and the graduate schools I want to go to. My professor gives me the highest compliment possible: “you could go to a French grad school if you wanted to”.

So that’s the story of how Duolingo got me about 90% of the way to graduate-level conversation. I think it’s an excellent tool that made the language make sense for me in a way traditional classes couldn’t.

Today, about 40% of the time I wake up, I start thinking in French. And Duolingo got me there, so I’m a devout acolyte.

"I did Spanish and German on Duolingo for over six years. I also played around with Japanese and French, which I already know. 

There is good and bad. I've seen some improvements in the Japanese course, and while there are a lot of mistakes, especially with pronunciation, the course is more comprehensive than before. As for the other languages, I think they have long ago surpassed the point where they're useful. 

At some point in your studies you need to abandon your native language and work as much as possible in the target language. This means reading or listening in the target language and then responding in the target language. But Duo has only added more sentences to translate, and they keep updating the courses with more sentences to translate. The method never progresses. The added sentences are more and more esoteric and the more complex they get, the more possibilities there are for translations. So if you want to become a professional translator, this might be a good exercise to do daily and then look at ""solution viewer"" on the web version to see more possible translations. 

If you're looking to become fluent in a language, and think and function in that language, then it will just never happen, because more often than not you're spending more time in your head in your native language than the target language. You never get the flow of it. 

The AI sentences and translations are more and more apparent. The sloppiness is apparent. The TTS is apparent. In French, when you're choosing words from the word bank, you hear the TTS voice one word at a time. But that's not how French works. In Japanese, the TTS is often just plain wrong, because many kanji have multiple pronunciations and Duo can't figure it out. 

But more than that, language is about people. It's about interaction with humans and their culture, and Duo is sorely lacking human input and culture. It treats language like it's just math, just a number, with a distinct lack of human and cultural input that shows more and more as they replace humans with machines. I also think this is ruining language learning as a whole, as the machine translations become the reference. The more machine learning references itself, the more it degrades the language learning process as a whole.",0.048,0.885,0.068,0.2968,Positive

To my point— it’s definitely different from my angle like 1) Spanish and Portuguese are very contextual right—so like you have zero context whatevsoever certain things like whether you’re taking to one person or multiple, or a male or female etc change. But they will give a a question w zero context and I just pick one and it’s wrong lol like why tho? It’s not ….OR 2) like there are multiple ways to say things. Like other languages. So I will answer in a way that I KNOW is correct grammatically and every way—and it will mark it wrong bc (I’m assuming-) it’s looking for one answer only.

"For many Duolingo is the very fist or even only thing they associate with language learning tools. Just like the „Hotell? - Trivago“-meme, but for language learning tools. It’s a shame if the folks that really wants to learn a language, that downloads the app and gets motivated to learn, gets discouraged right away.

Duolingo does surely have its share of problems: Some people do get kind of ""stuck"" in the app and end up with nothing but a large streak and little practical experience with the language. That part should absolutely be criticised. You need to write, speak and read longer texts to get confidence to actually use the language.

But on the flipside, some do also use Duolingo as sort of stepping stone to language learning, which will later be combined with other tools. But at the very beginning, when you are a bit unsure how and where to start(which I totally can understand, with so many approaches and almost ""cult-like"" following around some of them) and just want to get started, Duolingo can really get the ball rolling.

What is the problem IMO is not criticism of Duolingo (although lot of it is justified), but the undivided negative comments it seems to get sometimes. The main problem IMO is not Duolingo as a isolated concept, rather that some belive Duolingo is this one-stop all-in-one solution and that you can completely learn a language trough it alone, which must be one of the greatest lies in language learning. If you only use Duolingo you will end up with a streak, knowledge of some vocabulary and common expressions but not very much more, to paraphrase. But if you have the more nuanced view that it could indeed be a good, fun tool, and a pretty good way to learn basic vocabulary which is best combined with other resources, then that is a much healthier view IMO. I think the discussion about the tool should also reflect this: That we do talk about the bad sides, but also acknowledge the importance of a simple, fun, well known app that do act as a engaging introduction to language learning for many folks that otherwise would not have started.",0.104,0.742,0.154,0.9737,Positive

"Yeah there is a lot about Duolingo's efficacy research that should give you pause. Let's take the Jiang et al. (2021) study for example

1. As others have pointed out, university-level foreign language classes have notoriously variable outcomes depending in the student and program. Most are unmotivated and taking courses for a foreign language credit, and don't care about learning the language. It hasn't that hard to outperform them with 3 months of intensive language study, even with a textbook.

2. The effect sizes for these studies are tiny. For example, a Cohen's of the 0.2 in the 2021 study is small, almost negligible. (See Boulton, 2016, for a discussion of effect size benchmarks in CALL. Anything less than 0.4 is negligible for Cohen's d).

3. The biggest problem with this research is my opinion is how Duolingo is using it. They show marginally better results using questionable comparisons (and in some cases, using their own proficiency tests to prove efficacy rather than independent standardized assessments), yet turn around and hold them up to claim that ""Duolingo will make you fluent!"". I've seen them present at academic conferences - they are uncomfortably boastful and get a lot of sideways looks about these studies.

"The hate comes from a few things.

* A lot of people have been on Duolingo through many of their significant changes, and people hate change. It's just human nature (whether the change is for the better or worse - which I won't get into here)
* Some of Duolingo's language courses are pretty pathetic. Only a few units, hardly any vocabulary, poor quality speech. They're not representative of the ""good"" courses (Spanish, French, German, probably a few others) but they still color someone's impression of the app if that's the course they used.
* Duolingo has a lot of gamification, which a lot of research shows does help learning. HOWEVER, if you follow these threads long enough you'll see all the people that game the system and ramp up points and quests without ever advancing in their language. Like anything, there is a right way and a wrong way to use it. But when people see Duolingo users more concerned about points than about how well they understand a language, it gets a bad reputation.
* Part of it comes from people's expectations that they can become ""fluent"" (whatever that means) by spending 5 minutes/day on an app and not doing anything else. I'm sorry, but that's not going to happen.

Personally, I think Duolingo is a useful tool. There are a lot of good parts of it. It also has a lot of weaknesses. I am almost done with the Spanish course (one of the longest and most developed) and I will finish it out, but I also use other resources. I definitely recommend Duolingo to beginners in one of the more developed courses, but I also suggest they start looking at additional resources before they get too far into their studies.",0.075,0.827,0.099,0.7895,Positive

">For instance, this one open access paper (2021) found Duolingo users out-performing fourth semester university learners in French listening and reading and Spanish reading.

So here's the thing - 1, it does not claim they outperform university students, they're saying it's comparable. However, that seems somewhat false ([Paper 1](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/e961b214-6edf-4531-8f99-c26be0a2257c/content) and [Paper 2](https://www.languagetesting.com/pub/media/wysiwyg/research/articles/Tschirner-2016-Foreign_Language_Annals.pdf) because Wiley has a fucking paywall).

Duolingo's goal is to make money, not teach people languages. They use things like streaks to gamify the platform and retain users. Does that mean their entire app and approach are ineffective? No, but it means that when they make decisions, it's made with the goal of making a profit, which will not always align with making language learning better or easier for their users.

It lies to people about efficiency and their results. Hundreds of hours just of a weak A2, that is not good.

Hard earned abilities? And how about the hard earned and better abilities of the actual self studying learners, who get prejudices based on Duolingo becoming the public synonyme for self teaching a language? 

Duo may not be total total BS, but is several times worse than any standard A2 coursebook (some of which are digital), and communicates different goals than the real ones.

"To directly address what you mention about outperforming university learners:

You mention that the users outperformed college students, specifically in reading, and in the case of French, listening.

Duolingo may teach you how to read to some level, along with a little listening practice, but that's basically it. And it's all broken down into tiny packages, repeated ad infinitum. It will not teach you how to:

- Understand any spoken dialogue longer than one sentence
- Read a news article
- Recognize verb tenses when you see them

I know this to be the case, because the above skills require lots of exposure to master, and Duolingo doesn't provide this. You don't learn how to talk to your friend about your weekend by repeating ""My new elephant was delivered yesterday"" 100 times. In fact, that sentence might even give you some vocab that *would* be useful in such a situation. But you can't apply it because you generally need to see words in a few different contexts to really know how they are used (case marking, anyone?). Plus, you don't want to associate a word to one particular sentence - that just gives a bigger barrier to using it elsewhere, at least in my case. So repeating sentences as often as Duolingo does isn't good.

And we haven't even started on the fact that it doesn't teach you how to output (speak or write) beyond, again, a few infinitely repeated phrases. You might learn how to ask for water in a restaurant, but draw a blank when the waiter asks if you want ice. And writing? Good luck texting a story to a friend when Duo never taught you how to conjugate any past tenses properly!

So I guess this echoes what other people say: Duo *might* be good at the start when you just need some basic vocab. This gives you a base to start to use other methods (e.g. reading subreddits in the TL that talk about everyday topics) that are actually interesting. The problem is that it markets itself as this magic solution that will make you fluent if you use it, and *only* it.

Duolingo has taught me to read Spanish quite well and I can write Spanish quite well too because when I'm reading or writing, it gives me time to go slow. I have the time to pick apart the sentences when I'm reading or choose the correct form of a verb or the correct vocabulary when in writing. Where Duolingo fails is that it has not taught me to comprehend the language quickly, so when someone is speaking Spanish my brain can't keep up with it. I also have trouble speaking Spanish for the same reason, unless I'm speaking really slow and thinking about every word, I can't put it together quickly enough to speak smoothly/fluently. Duolingo does read out loud to you but it almost always shows you the sentence on the screen at the same time so I find that my brain just automatically ignores what I'm hearing and only pays attention to what I'm seeing.

"I’m learning Italian, although very new, only about 60 days in and Duolingo has been my primary practice mode. I’ll usually do about 30-45 mins with Duolingo and then do something else (flash cards, reading a children’s story with translations, watching a tv show, or reading a news story with a translation tool). I typically spend about 1.5 hrs per day.

Here’s what I like (mind you I’m a paid user so I don’t care about the hearts system):
-It’s a low barrier to entry (the paid version for my wife and I to share was $130 for the year) and that’s a lot of content for a low price
-the gamification (milestones, awards, leagues, etc) keeps me motivated to do a little bit everyday, and once I start it’s easy to keep going (an analogy would be like Duolingo is the drive to the gym, once you are there it’s easy to work out). 
-the content effectively builds on itself, and the practice tools are useful and fun
-it helps you practice all the skills at the same time (reading, listening, writing, speaking). 
-the lessons are digestible and short. If I only have a few minutes on some day, I can at least do something, rather than skipping entirely
-it’s accessible. I always have my phone so it removes any excuse. 

Here’s what I don’t like:
-it doesn’t explain why certain things work the way they work. For example, why you should use al vs alla. You need to figure this out in context, which if you are paying attention, willing to use google, or as a last resort post on Reddit, you can figure it out. 
-each unit can get repetitive near the end. IMO, each section is about 5-10 lessons too long. The final sections I’m blowing through each each lesson in 2 minutes or so. That said, I get why they do it. It’s drilling you basically and all in all it’s probably worth it. 

All in, I think it’s a great tool, but like any good tool it’s only as useful as other tools in your toolbox. I like that it helps me get basic concepts understood that I can apply to other things. 

All that said, my experience with this sub has been that it gets impatient with people who are true beginners like myself sometimes where the specific language learning subs that I subscribe to r/Italianlearning and r/Englishlearning are much more welcoming to explaining basic grammatical nuances to beginners.",0.019,0.843,0.138,0.9933,Positive
"People seem to generally have unrealistic expectations for Duolingo. Is it their marketing? Maybe. Is it the fault of those people themselves falling victim to wishful thinking? Maybe. Is it a problem of most people having no prior formal foreign language education? Maybe. I think it's a bit of everything. Whatever the reason however the general expectation for many people is that Duolingo is some sort of one stop shop to fluency. It's not, and I think a lot of the ""hate"" Duolingo gets is people just trying to inform others of that fact, which believe it or not is often met with denial or even anger as their dreams of learning another language with just a game like app are shattered. Sure, some people are just elitist. They didn't learn through Duolingo and hate it for no particular reason. But for the most part the hate is just trying to explain to people that learning a language is a long and committed process that requires a multitude of resources and methods. 

Duolingo is great as an introduction tool, it's great for practice, the streak system is surprisingly effective at helping people remain engaged and committed, and it's free, which is great because that makes it accessible. A lot of people in the world don't necessarily have the money to spare for books or lessons.

However Duolingo has many flaws. It hates giving any meaningful grammar explanations, it's very rigid, insisting on specific unconventional methods which they claim are more effective, some would say they're just more game like and boost engagement at the expense of their overall quality. It keeps a list of the vocabulary you learn but doesn't let you check it. Exercises are repetitive and vague. You can click on the same exercise a bunch of times and it won't be identical every time but rather a randomly generated assortment of questions based around a common theme. This makes revisions a game of roulette, and in fact if you have any questions Duolingo has no answers. It'll just keep throwing the same questions at you until you get it right. There's only so much you can get away with not divulging before you get in the territory of creating fundamental gaps in the learner's knowledge that will follow them forever until they consult another resource. Duolingo claims they keep grammar and explanations to a minimum because they believe people learn better through interactive exercises rather than reading about rules and etymologies. I wouldn't be so sure, but it's not like it matters because all they offer is their ""method"". 

For me, having had formal foreign language education in the past and having a C2 degree made these shortcomings obvious, but it also meant I could identify what Duolingo is useful for and what it's not. I like it as a training tool and the streak is keeping me ""honest"". But for people who are getting into language learning for the first time, it's severely lacking, and it gives a very wrong impression of what the process should be like. For many of those people, this leads to frustration and abandoning their attempts, thinking there's no better way to learn.",0.102,0.753,0.145,0.9897,Positive
"For me personally, I use Duolingo as a ""top-up"" service and not a ""learning"" service.  The same way I might use Clozemaster equally. Having high frequency sentences and recall has not just helped me retain lots of vocabulary and grammar points in many languages, it has also aided my general memory. 

I have been using Duolingo everyday for 4 years, perhaps 2-3 lessons on average everyday. This is not however my main source of language learning. I use immersion-like training (films/books etc. coupled with Anki) and traditional textbooks for grammar and cultural points. 

Duolingo, in my opinion, will not make you fluent and it is not a replacement for older and more traditional methods. Yet, I have a great respect for what it does do and that is it provides me with sentences that I do not have to source and it encourages me to deal with grammatical problems or vocabulary based tasks which allows me to remember more and more. 

I have not learned several languages through Duolingo alone, but the hate it receives seems to me to be due to changing layouts/systems, the general gamification (which is not for everyone) and the impression that it could make you fluent; which is implied by the company itself. All things which I have never been bothered by or concerned about. 

Personally, I am happy with Duolingo and what it can do and I think that the complaints are not effective and Duolingo will continue to advance as it would like because people who do not enjoy the service, can equally find many other platforms that would fit their ideals and goals.",0.062,0.847,0.091,0.6778,Positive
"I'll start by saying what I say any time the value of Duolingo is discussed which is: the difference in quality between the different languages on the platform is so significant that it's virtually meaningless to talk about Duolingo without specifying the language.  
  
In your post you mention French, which is one of the primary languages that the app focuses on and as such has a much higher quantity and quality of material. Of course with any language app there can be a reasonable expectation that some courses will be more developed than others, but in the case of Duolingo the differences can be huge, not just in terms of development but in terms of fundamental structure. Users have reported that the Navajo course can be completed in under a week and the Hawaiian course is apparently similarly limited, yet despite this Duolingo still proudly boasts about its ""Indigenous/minority"" language courses. This looks tokenistic at best.  
  
There is also the constant A/B testing performed on users with no option for them to opt in or out.  
  
I think Duolingo has its place in language learning but people shouldn't blindly support Duolingo without considering alternatives, particularly if they aren't learning one of the flagship languages.

"My main critic would be with languages that deviate from english significantly. Spanish and French are of a different language family compared to english, but they are also similar enough to get at the very least *a sense* for the grammar without extensive grammar lessions. But what about languages such as japanese, or korean? 

i have had a friend learn that 私は = Me/I 
instead of:
私 = me/i 
は= topic marker

and i doubt any person could phaseably learn what a topic marker is by context alone. especially when it doesn't exist in english. if anything, it might pass as a subject marker, but that's what が does already, and that would just further confuse the person

When the language ever so slightly deviates from english, people already have a lot of biases and assumptions from their native (embarassado =  pregnant. Not embarassed). if it's just words, that can still be solved by exposure. but if you were to try and teach a person... say, how to use こと, or adjectives in japanese, through context alone, they would look at you weird.

(こと is used to nominalize verbs, meaning ""running"" becomes a noun: ""the act of running"". adjectives in japanese function similar to verbs, and are conjugated aswell, which is COMPLETELY different from what English does)

whenever studies stop at just the most similar languages to english, and most common languages people study (compare german nouns to russian's, for example), i have to assume they have a lot of information just laying around to understand them, but start to look into japanese, and you NECESSARILY have to pick up a grammar book, otherwise you're pretty much on your own.

Duolingo is not terrible to practice. But it's definitely not what it builds itself up to be. It's a practice app that requires a much much deeper self-study plan in order to understand the language, it's really not a language learning app.


i also have to call into question if it isn't the courses that are terrible, rather than the app being good. The school system isn't really good, and if the 4th year program requires you to be able to conjugate verbs to the: present simple, past simple, and MAYBE conjunctive, i don't think that's a good use of your time to begin with.",0.059,0.88,0.062,0.6424,Positive

I agree with this but despite Duolingo's marketing spin of ""you're not learning if you're not using the app"", this is not necessarily a desirable quality. Duolingo compares itself and wants to be compared to social media in terms of the value of the time one spends with it. But that begs the question. Are many people they hooked the app to replaced their social media addiction with a good habit or another slightly less bad addiction instead?

I don't want to sound so hard leaning on anecdotes but my experience observing many others using Duolingo is that they used it way past its level of usefulness (in large part due to the psychological tactics Duolingo uses to keep their users engaged), for those who are highly motivated, they keep making progress because they likely will be pulling from a broad range of resources, for the ""casual"" user that Duolingo is particularly targeting, odds are good that when they quit Duolingo after feeling like they are only doing it as an obligation to keep their streak, they will likely quit learning altogether.",0.042,0.826,0.132,0.9772,Positive

"Duolingo has gone through some significant changes to make it worse. 

However, a lot of the hate is overblown. Ideally, yes, you would not rely only on Duolingo. However, Duolingo is good for a few reasons. 

1) Duolingo will get you to a basic A1-A2 proficiency. This is a good baseline which you can then supplement with direct convos, books, immersion, etc. 

2) Duolingo is low commitment, fun, and addicting for many users. Yes, there are other more effective methods. But a lot of people are put off, intimidated, or overly bored with other learning methods. The vast majority of people w/ a passing interest in a language are not going to do the polyglot grind shit that is common on this subreddit and on youtube. Most people are not going to grind an hour or more today for years straight like is glorified here. Is that what it really takes to learn a language to fluency? Yeah, but are most people going to be able to jump straight into that? Hell no.  

Contrasting it with shitty university language courses is a fair comparison. Yes, language learning in the US sucks and most people are monolingual. So they take high school and college courses and still know very little. If Duolingo can help them build confidence and get more into the language, then great.  

Now are the criticisms of Duolingo valid? Yes. It will not get you to ""fluency."" Is a lot of the gamification and layout a waste of time? Yes. Does it lack enough supplemental resources to enhance your learning? Absolutely. But ultimately Duolingo is a tool that does have a place. If you look at it in context and apply it appropriately, then it is good. 

I have a niece who is 8 years old half Indonesian and half Chinese. Her parents are not putting her in any sort of language classes. She is not going to follow a serious study schedule nor is she going to allow me to teach her what I know.

When I used duolingo for Japanese the order that they taught phrases, words and kanji was really odd to me and I felt like it was too easy to get stuck on hiragana/katakana for way too long. With Japanese especially a lot of early learners take too much time to learn kana and use romanization as a crutch when you really just need to power through it for maybe a week or two and just accept that reading will get gradually easier the more you practice.

"I’m not a professional linguist, but I do have a BA in linguistics and postgrad study in second-language learning and teaching, and I completely agree: the Duolingo hate makes very little sense to me.

Granted, recently the company has been cutting back some really important features. At least for some languages, there’s now no grammatical explanation at all. Not a big deal for those of us who know the technical stuff, just inconvenient, but I can only imagine it’s a huge PITA for most.

With that said, though, I think that people who say that Duolingo works in a way that totally goes against recent research on language acquisition are basically talking out of their asses. The reality is that a consistent picture hasn’t really emerged about which learning/teaching methods work well and which don’t. Different studies have yielded totally different results. Personally, I would take that as a hint that it’s rather more complicated than just “which methods works best?”. A better question, IMO, is “which methods works best for which languages and for whom?”

By its nature, I think that Duolingo has some things that are potentially much better than just textbook-based learning. Principally I mean that it gets you using the language, albeit only in a limited way. Most textbooks nowadays try to do that as well, but the extent to which that is possible is inherently limited by the medium. In reality, unless you’re taking a class based on a textbook or you really know how to use a language textbook effectively, you’re likely to fall into the trap of progressing through the book without practicing everything you learn from it enough that it actually sinks in they way it should. Duolingo doesn’t let you fall into that trap so easily because you get a decent amount (still not enough, IMO) of revision lessons.

I feel that a lot of people judge Duolingo by a different standard to how they judge a textbook. Fundamentally, neither can provide everything you need to learn a language efficiently or effectively. Exposure to the language is essential, ideally in authentic contexts. As of late, if you want to use Duolingo, you’ll also need access to a good grammar book, or preferably some kind of instructor. That’s because of the removal of grammatical explanation. But if you appreciate Duolingo for what it really is (and not necessarily what it’s marketed as), then I really think it’s actually pretty good. Could it be better? Absolutely. But is it ‘bad’?

Obviously Duo is no magic bullet that's going to make you fluent in five minutes or whatever. 

Duo is going to be less structured than a formal textbook or university course. It's going to make you think and figure out how the language works on your own, without spoon-feeding you everything.

Another thing to consider is that there are a number of languages that are offered, but not all of them are as popular as the Spanish, French, German, Italian, etc. courses are, and so consequently they don’t get as much attention.

In my eyes, as long as you're engaging with the language, you're learning. Not everyone has the funds, time, or headspace to learn through high intensity courses, full immersion, or challenging apps and programs. Some people have full time jobs, disabilities, mental illnesses, or simply a lack of motivation to invest as much time as someone whose goal it is to become fluent as quickly and efficiently as possible. And that's okay. Some people like just dabbling in language learning. Some people use Duolingo as more of a mobile game to pass some time and learn some words on the side. Is Duolingo the most effective tool to learn? No, probably not. Is it one of the most accessible ways to get started? Yeah, I'd say so. The barrier of entry is extremely low, and that's what a lot of people need to start on something as intimidating as learning a new language. 

In the end I think we should all take the stick out of our asses and let people learn in the ways they feel are best, and not come in with criticism and advice where none was requested.",0.103,0.772,0.125,0.6903,Positive

I'm no professional in learning/teaching languages and I personally think that Duolingo has it flaws, for example not going too deep into the material and explaining how the language's grammar works, but I think for trying a language out and seing how it works on a basic level, it is a good thing.

The reason why I don’t like Duolingo is that it’s designed to keep you on there. It’s good at manipulating your attention and profits the longer you spend time on it. I think it’s best strength is at the very start at learning a language as it can be a good way to see if you like the language without committing too much

"IMO Duolingo is a great platform, which with some more development could be excellent. The only problem are those who expect using thousands of hours only on Duolingo will teach them how to speak a language. I’ve never once assumed that and thus have used it more sparingly as a supplement to conversation practice, reading/podcasts, Anki and grammar-books. I’d appreciate if there was a more detailed rundown of grammar when moving onto new concepts and such, but I mostly rely on other means for this anyway.

">Also, not to be a fanboy, but I think the duolingo shortcomings might be deliberate trade-offs to encourage people to stick with it over time and not get too bored with explanations.

Important to note, not all language courses on Duolingo are created equal. French, Spanish and German are the big ones which actually do offer *some* explanations. Out of those three, I've only studied a bit of Spanish, and when I messed up a gender of a word, it gave me a reminder of the genders and how they work. But when I was studying Italian and made a mistake with the genders, all I got told was that I made a mistake and what the correct answer would've been. This has a huge effect on motivation when starting out.

Granted, I haven't used Duolingo in over a year so I don't know if the Italian course has improved, but my point still stands: not all courses are created equal. Cherrypicking the most developed courses as examples is just disingenuine.",0.048,0.816,0.136,0.9457,Positive

Idk if this is something duolingo itself cultivated or if people just started assuming that but you’ll find lots of people that think duolingo can take you from zero to fluency, or at least high proficiency, and that’s just not true. 

Then again, it’s not true for anything. There is no one source that can make you fluent in a language. Duolingo is one of many resources. Depending on how you use it, it can be quite effective, especially for beginners. I find it to be an easy way to incorporate a target language into my daily routine when I’m just starting out.

Duolingo is a wonderful app if the language is easy to learn for example I learned French on it and it was pretty successful but not for Chinese.

"I myself went back and forth with Duolingo as I went from dabbling (which it is great for) to pushing through the wall that divides beginner and intermediate (which a few years ago was not great for Irish--my target language). I came to realize that while it does have its faults and it isn't fully comprehensive (i.e. they removed the forums), it does give learners a push to maintain consistency with a language even if that is just a 5 minute lesson a day with a few new words. It's something. And I find myself reminded to use the language more outside of Duolingo as well.

Now, though, there have been more lessons and audio added to Duolingo's Irish program and I've found it more enjoyable to use at the high intermediate level. It not having audio before was a real deal breaker past dabbling, but I'm glad they fixed it. Now, if they could just get the stories included for it like they do for Spanish and other majority languages. 😁

Thanks for the research. Though some might be a bit biased as it is written by people closely linked to Duolingo, I think it mainly shows that consistency, no matter how small, is key and that the app does a good job reminding people to practice and use a little bit each day if nothing else.

The day after my last lesson, I went to a funeral and ended up having a conversation with someone who did not speak English.  I was complimented on my Spanish.  Was I fluent?  Absolutely not.  Did I get stuck?  Of course.  But it gave me the encouragement I needed to continue learning using other methods.  Today, I am quite conversant in Spanish and use it every day.

A few papers funded by Duolingo won't make it. However there is sustained scientific evidence in what the subs recommend the most: 

-Spaced Repetition (Anki)
-Increased Exposure Difficulty (Get always exposed to content a tiny bit over your current level while understanding most)
-Grammar Books
-Novels and books to read
-Immersion (Surround yourself with the target language consuming content on it)

"No language app is perfect, and everyone for whatever language their learning should use multiple in conjunction with other resources as well; everyone should have their expectations in check and realize no app is going to make them comfortable, to the extent they want to be, in their target language. however, I'm going to adamantly defend it for a second. 

The best language learning app is the app that you will USE. And one thing Duolingo does better than probably any other is get people to actually use it and keep using it. So it's far better to use Duolingo all the way through a course, than it is to buy Pimsleur or Babbel and just do the first few lessons and then get bored and lose interest. So, if Duolingo is more fun, and will get someone to actually stay engaged and active with the language, then by all means Duolingo is probably the best option for that person. 

So...in relation to those studies that say Duolingo is effective in helping people learn a language?...yeah, they're probably correct. Undoubtedly, if someone is regularly using the app over a long period of time to learn a language, then they're going to do better than someone who isn't using it.

Also, my kids love to watch me do a lesson because of the animations, which makes it more fun for me, too.

Edit, to expand a little: For better or worse, DuoLingo relieves you of having to plan: no reason to decide on what to learn, to think about what success means for learning, to keep track of progress, etc. A key aspect of the gamification is that it makes those choices for you and that progress becomes more tangible (even if the measure used for progress is *highly* debatable).

"I understand the complaints about duo and often times I myself find it a bit boring, too repetitive, and not the best tool in the world, but I think it’s kinda crazy that most people either love it or really really hate it, it’s so polarising. I think I’ll always appreciate it greatly because it’s a vast resource of free knowledge in way more languages than most other apps and websites. I don’t think a serious learner should use just duo but I don’t think any singular app or website can fully bring someone to fluency on its own so it makes no sense to judge it by that standard.

We live during a time where language learning is the most accessible it’s ever been and duolingo was and still is a big part of that movement. Duolingo opened up language learning to the common person way more than any other tool has because it’s free and fun and at our fingertips. It’s not just for language learning nerds that are extremely picky about their tools and methods, it’s for the random older monolinguals who haven’t encountered a foreign language but have always wanted to learn a new one, it’s for the person who has Alzheimer’s in the family and wants to challenge their brain, it’s for the mom who wants to learn Danish for her language nerd daughter but has no idea where to begin (my mom lol), it’s for the young kids who like their language classes in school and wanna keep practicing at home, it’s even for the advanced learners that want reinforcement of what they already know or want to learn random vocab they missed along the way.

"I absolutely love Duolingo.

(Or I did till they massively updated it recently.  I haven't experimented with the new version so I might or might not love that.)

I think most people who use it simply ""get the answers right"" and then are shocked they don't actually learn much.

Like, if Duo shows you, ""हाथी सड़क पर है"" and then gives you the words, ""road is The the elephant on"" 99.9% of people are going to know it's ""The elephant is on the road"" even if they can't read Hindi.

So then people end up playing Duo as some dumb ""word ordering game"" where they simply make sentences in English (/their mother tongue) and then move on.

&#x200B;

If you close your eyes, repeat the sentences till you can say them well, use your brain to figure out the answers before you look at the wordbank and all these kinds of ""adult learner"" things, then Duolingo's great.

Indeed, all of a sudden the things that people complain about become the things that are good about it.

For example, when you're playing a game of ""road is The the elephant on"" you might get bored of seeing it four times.  If you just can't seem to keep in your head that in Hindi ""on"" is a postposition (not a preposition) then you'll appreciate the repetition.",0.055,0.845,0.1,0.8491,Positive

I then switched to Italian to prepare for my exchange semester. After 6 months of studying sporadically on Duolingo I passed the A2 course and got into the B1 course on campus.

At one point I used it to learn Cyrillic, but then I got bored. So I can read the letters now but nothing more came out of it.

I have tried other apps, but even those with streaks similar to Duolingo have not convinced me to keep coming back. I think it is cause duolingos lessons are so short and quick but they also keep introducing new material at the same time as they have you working old material, so you constantly make some progress even if you only do a short lesson. A lot of other, similar apps got a bit boring for me, but Duo doesn’t. The app is quite quick and fun to use as well.

1. All of the content is free. This has been mentioned a number of times and it's quite self-explanatory. I've tried a number of other providers and most are behind a pay wall. Fair enough from their point of view, but doesn't suit me. I'd love to drop £5k on Instituto Cervantes courses but I can't. 
2. The spaced repetition is integrated and at the right pace. I'm talking about the Spanish course, which I understand is their best-developed one. Quality varies from course to course and from what I can see, it's not worth bothering with anything other than Spanish and French (possibly German). I did some of Buzuu and it introduced me to the past perfect, spent a couple of lessons on it and then proceeded to something different, never to re-visit that concept again.

The phrases and sentences are often odd, and I don't think it helps me with grammar. It does not help me to see patterns, etc. But that's just imo. I should probably add that I do have particular neurodivergences, so I need to take a heavily active approach to almost anything that I want to learn.

Edit: Overall, the concept of the app is amazing, and I remember following it when it first came out.

It's fun, it's free, it's taught me a new language and it facilitates daily consistency easily, which is something I value.

You can absolutely get to A2 with Duolingo in conjunction with comprehensible input and communication with natives, and I think that's something often underestimated.

And the average person doesn't seem to treat them like a complete joke. Wanna guess how many who aren't dedicated language learners heard of Pimsleur, Mango, LingQ or Anki?

2. Duolingo first and foremost appeals to the ""casual"" who doesn't really have any learning goals and dont like moving off their comfort zone to challenge themselves. One of the loading screen taglines compares 15 minutes of Duolingo to 15 minutes of social media. That's the bar Duolingo sets for its audience.

"I started Japanese Duolingo at about the A1-A2 level. 

At the time Japanese from English didn't exist so I was doing the early levels purely to translate them into the forums. 

Which isn't to say I didn't learn anything from Duolingo. It really wasn't long before I was running into new words and sentence structures I had read grammar guides for but never internalized. 

Since I already had a background with Japanese the lack of grammar explanation was fine. I could either pick up on it intuitively or look up the grammar point on one of the other sites I frequented. In fact Duolingo was my first contact with MANY grammar points in Japanese.

Since I was on Duolingo so often (and often had the volume off) I made huge gains on my reading speed too. Honestly Duolingo was the source of the most amount of gain for me. It's the only app I've seen do a CI format well (mind you I started Duo in 2014 and there wasn't a lot of options). I learn best from pattern and usage and within the context of sentences.

From there I bounced off into picking apart native media, but **apps aren't supposed to take you from zero to fluency anyway.**

Now I'm working on German, and I really wanted to stair-step it. But JPN → GER doesn't exist on Duo. It DOES however exist on Memrise, and I've been trying genuinely to use Memrise. However, I keep finding myself going back to Duolingo because Memrise doesn't focus on the areas most useful to me. It's very word focused, there are sentences but you have to meander through a TON of single words before you get to them. And frankly there's a lot of dead wood in there I just can't use. At beginner stages in a language I mostly talk to myself. I have no need for words like Prost (cheers) or ""would you like a bottle or a glass"". Duolingo, I feel, is better at it's situational sentence choices. It's a little more like an SRS phrasebook if I'm honest, and it just kind of works out for me.

With German, I suspect I'll outgrow it sooner than I did with Japanese, which is fine. Right now my goal is to build up situational vocabulary and sentence patterns. From there I'll start picking through media.

I STARTED by picking through German media, and the frequency of new words was just too high to keep up with. 

:) And it's OK that Duolingo doesn't work for you, or for everyone. But it DOES work for some people beyond ""getting your feet wet"". Though that's a LOT of users, and that's OK too. It's casual learner friendly, it piques their interest even if they don't get far in it. And you never know where that will take a person.

Likewise more ""popular"" apps have never worked for me. I HATE Anki with a burning passion. I can't learn from it, never have. I cheat that system more than I do Duo. I think Memrise is a fine inbetween, but have neither been able to find or even BUILD a deck that vibes with how my brain works. If I could build my perfect Memrise deck, I'd have the proficiency NOT to need it. x_x",0.032,0.803,0.165,0.9978,Positive
"I love it because it’s free and accessible. I really enjoy the way duolingo structures it’s lessons and I do feel like it is more of a natural way for me to pickup grammar and vocabulary. I’ve tried using anki and Memrise to learn vocabulary and I just can’t learn from flash cards. I personally enjoy that while duolingo does have grammar explanations for some languages, most of the time you have to figure it out based on context and patterns. Granted, this is harder in complex languages like Polish, but I think it’s great for Spanish and French as I feel like I’m actually learning based on context and practice instead of being spoon fed like on other apps. Personally, I like the “weird” or “unnatural” sentences on duolingo because I can tell that the app is trying to train me to either learn certain grammar features or learn sentence structures that I can apply in other situations, which I think is a huge shortcoming that apps like anki and memrise face. 

Another huge reason I love duolingo is because I am a law student and spend the bulk of my day using my brain to do very complex work. Some days I just simply don’t have the energy or time to do more than one lesson, and even doing just one lesson on duolingo helps me to stay motivated. I also have a limited budget because I am a student, and duolingo is largely the best free resource that I have found that works best for my learning style.  

Additionally, I am aware that duolingo will only get me so far in my language learning. I hate people whose main argument against Duolingo is that it won’t make you fluent. No one resource will every make you fully fluent. Instead, I think duo is a great place to start, and a great supplement to media and other resources. When I was doing Polish tutoring on italki I progressed so much faster because I was doing duolingo in between my lessons.

"I love learning languages.  I tried Duolingo for about four months before going to Germany.  I used it consistently, every day, for four months, and I thought that I got very good at Duolingo but not good at all at German.  In my experience, using Duolingo felt like cosplaying as someone learning a language.   Cosplay is great, just, when you find yourself on the edge of a rooftop in your foam rubber costume, remember that you're not _really_ ironman.

I think the app is very good at addressing people's insecurities about learning languages, and I can see how that's important.  I think a lot of how it works is geared towards making you feel like, ""oh, great!  I got that one right!  I'm getting better at this, I should keep going!""

That's all well and good, but insecurity isn't my problem.  I just want to learn the dang language.  After a while, I'm like, ""you're just giving me little dribbles of information and pausing every five seconds to make sure I'm doing ok!  I want you to turn on the firehose!

The courses themselves were structured, and still are I suppose. Concepts, even if they aren't explained, are introduced in a structured way to show patterns and give users the grammatical fundamentals needed. 

The problems are that many answers aren't accepted, and Duo has always been slow to allow many good alternatives. So it can be very frustrating for new users to constantly be told their answer is wrong. It's also demoralizing and discouraging. 

The total reliance on TTS is bad. I've moved on to other things, and now realize I never learned to listen on Duo. The TTS and spoon feeding of simple sentences is quite limiting. And the cartoon characters are so annoying I can't even look anymore.

"Thing is, if you look at the pattern of xp earned by people that have 100 and above streaks are pretty similar, doing a few lessons a day and that too just review lessons and other things.

A prime example was me vs my father. He used to do 1 review lesson a day just to maintain the streak and that was it. I used to do maybe 1 spanish lesson a day which progressed me thru the course but the rest of the time was just rapid reviews and I did two 15 minute shots a day which got me 2000 xp a day.

Why I like Duolingo:

1. It has a lot of languages that I'm interested in checking out
2. I can quickly do a lesson if I only have 2 minutes to spare
3. It allows me to get comfortable with a language before I invest time and money in a class on said language
4. They add things that I think are cool (for example the characters and their animations, hiragana and katana practice for Japanese, stories)

"Chinese was one of my first languages in Duolingo. Just to give some context I live in a country where Chinese is spoken almost daily because of the chinese population here. Although English is the first language.

Learning through Duolingo made me connect the dots of what was exactly said (vocab) although sentence structure (or some vocab) was abit off. I managed to get HSK1 cleared without relying much on textbooks or any traditional resources. (by this i mean i only looked at them 2 days before the exam 😂)

Will recommend Duolingo to get started and actually get to talking to natives or those who are proficient enough afterwards to double check what youre learning , or clarify any doubts you have. Then you can use other resources to get you further.

It's also why it is well established - easy entry level, cuz of how bite sized and less time consuming it is. It is basically VERY VERY beginner friendly, brand is well remembered, people associate the brand to a lifestyle and there's actual emotional connection formed while making it part of their routine.

"It's free, and it's arguably the best way to get your foot through the door and start learning a language. A lot of people want to learn a new language but for most of them, unless it's essential for their work, it's hard to commit to it when they have other things going on, and it also seems a bit daunting. It also doesn't help that usually to get started you have to get textbooks which usually cost a pretty penny. Who forks over that kind of money on textbooks they're not even sure they're gonna use in case they don't stick to the language.

Duolingo is just this super easy and free way to feel a language out and see what it's about. Do some basic exercises, start to feel like you're actually learning and that it's doable. I think that for the first couple of weeks it's actually pretty great. Not all the language courses are equal but overall it helps to get you familiarised and the streak system helps with commitment, which is important, especially early on. If you get through 2-3 weeks and you're liking it then that makes it a ""safer"" bet to actually get textbooks and get more seriously into it. It's how I got started on Japanese. On that note for me the best thing about Duolingo was that it helped me learn the two kana alphabets very easily and quickly, which was the most daunting thing for me which prevented me in the past to get started. 

After around 3 weeks I got textbooks and started studying more seriously and regularly. By that point Duolingo's limitations were pretty obvious. It likes to give ""answers"" but it doesn't have any actual explanations for anything. The ""guides"" are very vague and generalised and don't really give you actual grammar rules or explanations for anything other than just ""trust me bro just say this bro"". You can't even really do targeted practise since you're at the mercy of Duolingo's whims to decide what exercises you'll get, they're all dynamically generated based on what it thinks you need to work on. Going back to Japanese specifically, it's a great way to learn kana, but a horrible way to learn Kanji. At some point you realise that you're getting better at Duolingo specifically, but not necessarily better in your language learning. Especially if you've found a good rythm and are picking up fast this really bottlenecks your progress and speed of learning. Doesn't matter if you spam Duolingo for hours every day, it's not that much better than doing 20 mins per day. It gets trapped too much in its own gamiefied systems. You lose focus and instead of learning you concern yourself with arbitrary and ultimately pointless things like the streak or your xp. If you're really casual about your language learning it's fine, you'll learn a tourist level vocabulary and grammar that will help in a vacation trip, but if you want to actually learn you'll have to move on to something else.

Ultimately as you move on to better learning methods Duolingo is good to just keep you somewhat engaged and for some light practise for when you can't get a proper study session in. I like maintaining the streak, even if it's just with a single exercise per day, because most days I don't have time for a proper study session but doing something every day, even just a little bit, is better than doing nothing. It pretty much boils down to expectations. It's a decent free resource with many advantages mainly owed to its versatility. It has a ton of languages, some of which may be much harder to find material to get started with than others. If you use it lightly to get started and for practise it's ok, and its limitations won't rub you the wrong way.

I have tried Babbel, Busuu, Rosetta Stone, Mango, and FluenZ in the apps.  Mango is free through mostly large libraries.  Other than that, it like Babbel and Busuu have been expensive and boring replacements for a class.  Rosetta Stone was not worthwhile.  FluenZ was the best mixture of a class and app but slow and you really need an hour to get anywhere.  DL you can do a lesson in 15 minutes.  

Memrise, Drops, Anki are all just vocab.  I do Memrise with DL.  But they don’t do grammar.  They don’t do anything but vocab and you really are best mining from something else to use.  Why not not mine sentence from books and a course?   They work best with something like a course.  

I have done audio courses, phrasebook conversations like Pimsleur and grammar/intro including Michel Thomas, Paul Noble, and Language Transfer as well as Pimsleur level 1. They do best when used with a course.  You know like as in a college class, a self study guide course, or even an app like DL or Busuu.  

I have gone through a class with several other older couples that we know.  The people that do the best are the ones that have done the most in DL.  The class has done a few textbooks.  People get bored and they don’t finish.  

I have used graded readers, reading regular books, reading and listening to the Bible, Dreaming Spanish, and other CI.  

So I have tried pretty much some form of everything.  What DL does is make it easy to be consistent and do learn stuff.  That is probably the important thing that you can do to improve.  At least for Spanish, it has a fair amount of content.  It gives a larger vocab and practice of grammar than most apps.  It does cover to some extent all four strands, which most things don’t.  

Is it perfect, no.  Is it better than the alternatives that I have tried?   I would say yes.  At least it is for me.  I also know it has been used by a lot of people with good results.",0.017,0.787,0.196,0.9979,Positive

DuoLingo has been around for a while but has never made a profit and at best are only thinking of doing so in 2024.  

There are a lot of apps out there and many have a few courses.  But I don’t know any that have as many as DuoLingo does.  Very few courses will have more time than what the DL French and Spanish courses do.  

When you say it has low quality, what exactly are you referring to?   The visuals?   That is a stylistic choice, not a quality issue.  The voices are computer generated?   Lots of apps do that.  

Many of the complaints I see about it are things that are also true of any competing product.   But those products are recommended.  

It does all four strands reading, writing, listening, and speaking and teaches vocabulary and grammar.   It also does it according to the CEFR standards.  

It has a lower bar for entry into learning a language than most others so anyone can try it and learn something.  It also has had a few studies showing effectiveness versus college.  Few others do.

It's gameified, which is motivating and makes users more likely to keep learning.

At the end of the day, nothing beats making your own flashcards and working with a live tutor, but Duolingo is a powerful and realistic place to start, to reach a meaningful level of proficiency, and to supplement more intense learning if/when that's available",0.049,0.795,0.156,0.9172,Positive

"I think Duo is handy if you’re starting off a language (at least, for *most* languages - their languages with less content/less native speakers kind of thing, maybe less so). I’m bilingual (EN/FR)/did french immersion in school growing up, and took an intro university course for spanish over a decade ago. I found with spanish/portuguese, Duo does a decent job with laying the foundation/groundwork for the language out, but further on through the course it’s just the same repetitive sentences (I’ve completed the portuguese course/content they have on there, and ~60-65% through their spanish course). but there’s really none of the “why” such and such grammar rule(s) would apply or whatever the case would be, and as other people have said, you kind of stop “learning” the language and more so drift into a “recognize the pattern” mode. with russian I found that while it taught you the letters and what not, the grammar rules on sentence structure and verb agreement and whatever else got kind of glossed over, and again I learned to recognize the pattern of how they structured the sentences, not necessarily the rules governing them. arabic even more so - lots of time spent covering the characters (understandably so) but the lessons just basically toss you in and advance through content (without much explanation) fairly quickly (and I would say that I’m someone who can pick up languages fairly easily, the vast majority of the time). 

So Duo was my starting block, lots of free content, which most other apps you’d need to subscribe to. The main reason I continue to use it at the moment is probably because of my almost-700 day streak. But mainly I find it repetitive and not super useful at this point in my language learning (I haven’t taken any tests, but I would say ~B1-B2 in portuguese, ~B2-C1 spanish). I’ve recently started using anki for some spanish review, although I can’t say I’ve found a deck I really love yet (I use anki a ton for my MCAT studying content and definitely think it’s helpful for sure). downside is, I’m shitty at making decks soooo…

I’ve used busuu and like it because of the native speaker corrections on submissions part - but of course, you run into some people are just better/more knowledgeable about speaking and accent and whatever else in their native language than others are (as is the same for me with english, guaranteed there’s people out there who would give better corrections/explain grammar concepts or pronunciation better than I could🤷🏼‍♀️). 

if I had to pick a go to app at the moment (for spanish), I’d probably have to say Mango. not a ton of grammar/conjugation help, but gives me more practice actually speaking out loud/working on my accent and what not. A bit repetitive at times, but still better than Duo. Babbel I used for a bit, better than duo, but I’m not a huge fan of learning a language where I have to pick out letters from a jumble to spell out whatever they’re asking; if I’m learning a language, I want to learn it, not play word search. 

“Drops” is decently highly rated on the app store, but I thought it was garbage. my ADHD brain finds game-driven learning dull and boring, so that one was a hard pass. Also thought rosetta stone was straight trash (maybe it gets better if you get further along in it), but so much (too much) at the beginning was strictly just matching a picture to a word (or vice versa), which is just useless in my opinion (for me at least, as someone who likes learning languages to legitimately learn them and be able to have meaningful conversations (ie. more than just asking where a bathroom is) in said language kind of thing).

Then it should give duolingo-style exercises using already known words and words to be learned. And keep track of how well the user knows the word, and decide when to train it again based on that.

Let's be real Duolingo is not a game, that's hyperbole. What people are talking about is ""Gamification"", which Duolingo uses HEAVILY to increase engagement in the app. On top of the criticisms of the quality of the learning material, a lot of people find the blatant gamification to be obnoxious. And to be honest a lot of the app's design elements aren't for helping you learn the language, but to keep you using the app and paying them money, which is kinda messed up.

But the thing is it works... you see people on 1,000 day streaks who probably should've stopped using the app over 2 years ago. All the badges, xp, streaks, cute graphics and characters etc are there to keep you logging on every day, and that persistence is honestly a very good habit to keep up. Pretty much all habit-focused and learning apps made now are gamified, and Duolingo's success is a big reason for that.

Gamification is pretty controversial as for the few times it helps build good habits and help people, those same systems are mostly used for exploiting people, especially workers. That may be another reason Duolingo rubs people the wrong way.",0.085,0.737,0.178,0.9796,Positive

\- **Find a news app in your target language**. This is even better if it's a news app designed for kids

\- **Find music in your target language**. If you have a playlist that you listen to daily, start adding some from that language in. Finding ones you actually like is going to take a long time and listening to a lot of auto generated radios based on songs you kinda like, but... once you find an artist that you really vibe with, you'll be sailing and it will motivate you to keep learning.

\- **Movies and TV shows**. This is a given, but it cannot be stressed enough. Not only do you have visual cues to help you figure out words and phrases but it's a lot of fun and you can put on subtitles in the target language and learn to read in that language at the same time! (Don't put subtitles on in your mother tongue. I can promise you it won't help)

\- **Books**. This one is tricky. If you happen to like Harry Potter or Hunger Games, they've basically been translated into every language, however I'm not a huge fan of JK Rowling's writing style so this got pretty annoying. Once I found some written originally in that language, it was a lot nicer and less clunky. But the nice thing is that it allows you to go at your own pace as well as practice pronunciations of unknown words in your head. 

\- **Dictionary**. This one goes hand in hand with all the previous suggestions. Find a dictionary app or website in your target language. Exhaust this first before you resort to a translator. You won't get immediate results but you'll start to get better at guessing the meaning of a word given a context. This can guide you to that and those words that do click will also stick.  


\- **Transcription**. Try transcribing a video or audio clip that already has a professional transcript available. You can then compare your results with the official transcript. This one is kind of tedious though so it's a great way to jump into a language in the beginning but probably not good consistently because it's so tiring.   


Ok sigh... That was a lot of information. I seriously didn't expect to write that much either.  


While I'm still writing, I might as well name a few things that didn't work for me.  


\- **Grammar books in my native language**. I found it to be an OK starting point, but what worked better for me was grammar explanation websites in the target language. 

\- **Duolingo**. No grammar explanations, tediously boring, too based around translation and its pronunciation checks were inaccurate and faulty.

\- **Podcasts**. I still listen once in a while to these but most of the time they're just so dry and I don't have any visual context to go around. 

\- **Anything designed for learning the target language**. I'm not sure if anyone else feels this way but those materials are just so dry. It's hard to learn a language if doing that makes you want to die inside.

\- **Trying to understand everything**. I put this last because I think it's the most important. You can try reading or watching a movies and pausing every time that you see a word or sentence that you don't understand, but this gets exhausting and demotivating really fast. Take a breath. It's okay not to understand everything; you're only human after all. There's nothing wrong with understanding only 90, 60, 40, 30, 10, 5, or even 1% of what you're learning. Enjoy the learning process and take it as slowly as needed. Nothing ever good happens from being impatient. Sometimes you need to hear things and not understand them 99 times just for it to click the 100th time.

"Anything that serves high and fast volume is going to help you learn faster.  Ideally with a laddered approach where the difficulty of vocabulary grows slowly but at a steady rate.

That is why reading, podcasts, and any other media that covers hundreds of words over a short period of time are optimal.   Most gamified apps are slow volume, so when you do them a 15-minute session may cover 200 words, whereas in the aforementioned you get at least 5x that number.

If you are learning 10,000 words, the more you see and hear them in context the better.  Duolingo just doesn't work fast enough for your memory to keep up with that volume.  That's also where Anki or SRS comes in, those words you rarely see need to be kept in memory; some you may see once or twice a year.  Anki keeps it in memory long enough for it to lock in, but Anki alone does not work (at least for me).   Its just keeps the word in your short term memory until you see it enough in immersion and hence, need to store it.

"Hi, EFL professor here. Duolingo is basically a syntax puzzle game. The reason it is ineffective as a language learning tool is that we don't learn languages by developing an analytical understanding of the grammar, we acquire them by taking in a large amount of comprehensible, interesting input.

For that reason, [I always recommend **LingQ**](https://www.lingq.com/?referral=wjrok). Whenever I introduce it to my students, I basically tell them that I shouldn't have a job because if they devoted class time to just reading and listening to the appropriate material then they would advance much farther than I could take them.

>But before you can do that you need a certain level of grammar and vocabulary.

I watch movies/tv shows ive seen before (in english) in Spanish so that I get the practice of hearing/reading Spanish, while also knowing the context of what is happening/being said, because i have seen the movie before.

I listen to Spanish music, and will often translate English songs into Spanish or vice versa. 

I have spotify, and occasionally i’ll listen to a podcast or audiobook in spanish although this is kind of rare, i havent had much luck finding podcasts i enjoy in spanish. 

I also have a friend from Argentina i text often. He speaks English, so we help each other out with learning our languages.

"Stop using Duolingo--it's a waste of time, effort & most of all, a total monopolistic distraction.

Let me elaborate with you Sr. Adolph4747: Expand & branch out into all possible apps, websites, or other helpful. As mentioned throughout the comment section, use YouTube & search certain areas of a language you're learning; as such, numerical system, verbs, adverbs, sentence structure, etc. After all, YouTube is quite a superpowered website. But, there can be some situations when YouTube cannot provide the substantial input required for learning a language.

Also, sometimes consider taking small steps forward, scrolling through articles lending basic or beginner phrases. Remember, everyone starts from somewhere.

Here are the sites I recommend for learning: ""How do you eat a cake? By breaking it up into smaller pieces.""

[Lingq.com](http://Lingq.com) \- Try utilizing its MP3 upload extension, accumulating a wide vocabulary, finding lyrics to a particular song, video, or even a lack of subtitles. Also, for the MP3 Site: [https://ytmp3.cc/en-TGOn/](https://ytmp3.cc/en-TGOn/)

[https://apps.ankiweb.net/](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) \- Create an account & explore the surplus of flashcards you can review (or create a new deck). (Since I'm learning Japanese & Spanish it's quite convenient to have preloaded software). Create an account on your phone if you're unable to access it via computer then synch. (If the link doesn't work, please google it). 

[Langpractice.com](http://Langpractice.com) \- To master & become entirely familiar with a numerical system in a language you must repeatedly do this daily if you are to become proficient.

[youglish.com](http://youglish.com) \- This one is quite strange, I haven't employed many studying operations.

[Vocabtracker.com](http://Vocabtracker.com) \- Once Lingq becomes menial in its free restrictions I recommend moving to this free site to begin practice reading & see which words you're unfamiliar with. It's a huge relief!

For non-digital devices, I strongly advise to find books in the language you're learning (do not be intimidated, for you start somewhere & can reach that point if you have determination). Pen & Paper; continue to read, write, speak, & memorize the words, phrases, grammar, sentences, etc. in your wondrous mind.

NEVER GIVE UP! Be better than you were yesterday! I also thank you greatly for having the courage & dexterity to begin learning a language.

"-Subscribe to online newspapers and read at least two articles a day. (Le Monde, El Tiempo, etc) 

-Lots of Kindle books with audible narration. 

-Podcasts on Spotify. (If you go to podcast rankings,  it has lists by country of the current most popular podcasts. It's a good way to find new things for listening practice.)

 - Let's Plays on YouTube for games I've played a 100x, like The Last of Us or RDR2, and already know the story. Looks for one that have captions in your target language and are played by people speaking that language. It also helps to learn how to read quickly, if you've got it on mute. 


- Cooking from recipes in your TL. Similarly,  googling for recipes or a how-to in your target language. 


- Switch the language for your computer's OS (and game console,  phone, app interfaces) to your TL. Depending on your level and the language,  it'll be either helpful or the worst, most irritating thing, ever.

"To anyone complaining(cuz i've seen a few comments here) why this was done before other languages

This course was almost done entirely by volunteers who wanted to help resolve the barriers between Chassidim and Haredim and other Jews a bit. And help secular Ashkenazim reconnect to a culture that was nearly wiped out after the holocaust, the privileging of Hebrew, and paarents not teaching it to their kids due to a number of reasons such as antisemitism shame, etc. It was slowly rebuilt post-holocaust and in recent years there's been a massive spike in interest since Yiddish is no longer as hated as it was in the past for a variety of reasons. 

And the course is also like 2-3 years late. And a lotta people have been waiting for them to release. There is no connection between Yiddish being completed and other languages not. The Yiddish course was especially hard to finish because it's' primary speaking base is fairly insular, and is not exactly using translations with speech engines, and massive online dictionaries, and such. Those things will come I think as the secular community demands them over the next decade(s). But each clip here had to be individually recorded, so it was really hard to complete. The course is quite long because of the dedication of the volunteers. And frankly, Yiddish needs that kind of dedication. Yiddish will probably remain as a dialect of the most religious Ashkenazi Jews til death do us part. Whether Yiddish can be revived into a minority language for less religious and secular Jews like Hebrew once was remains to be seen.",0.058,0.889,0.053,-0.5553,Negative

ETA: for folks who think the slightly (or very) nonsensical sentences are indicative of a poorly designed program: 


1. It's a way of checking understanding beyond context clues. For example, the words for deer (олень) and father (отец) are similar enough for a learner that if you're not pretty confident on ""deer"" you'll probably guess ""father"".

As a language teacher, language student myself, and a parent of a language student , I know very well that discipline is the key factor. A few others things that matter as well:

— consistency: stick with your learning and do as frequently as possible and the “compound effect” will help your skills abruptly “explode” at a certain point.

— speaking proficiency : focus on the ability to speak because it acts as a morale booster and an instant reward when you can converse in the language your learning. My go-to platform for conversation practice has been [iTalki](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=980371&u=2575880&m=70611&urllink=&afftrack=) due to its affordability and flexibility of choice, schedule and budget. Even better you can dictate to your tutors on what you’d like to focus on.


— Be a child in the sense of not being afraid to speak and make mistakes . That’s why kids learn languages so fast and so well. Be bold.

As stated (a few times now, actually), I am not JUST using Duolingo. It is a supplement to help practice my skills. I am a college student studying linguistics and various foreign languages alongside English and ESL education. I have the education to understand that Duolingo isn't enough on its own; this does not, however, make it obsolete or useless, because it is being used as a supplement and not a stand-alone.
